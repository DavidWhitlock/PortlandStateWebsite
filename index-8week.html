<p>CS399J provides students with a solid introduction and overview of
the fundamentals of the Java programming language and class libraries.
Students are expected to have a firm grasp programming concepts such
as loops, functions, and data structures.  Additionally, students are
expected to have a cursory knowledge of the Java programming language
and object-oriented programming gleaned from lower division courses.
It is recommended that students who have not been exposed to Java read
the first couple of chapters of the text book and work with some of
the below tutorials before attending class.</p>

<p>The textbook for the course is <i>Thinking in Java</i> by <a
href="http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIJ">Bruce Eckel</a>.  The
book can be downloaded for free as HTML or pdf.  A printed edition is
available from finer book sellers.  While the textbook covers many of
the topics that are discussed in CS399J, I do not "follow the book"
per se.</p>
