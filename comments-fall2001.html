    <h1>Previously on CS410J...</h1>

    <P>Okay, third time's the charm, right?  Well, I'll let my
    students be the judge of that...</P>

    <OL>

      <LI>What do you wish you had known before taking this
      course?</LI>

    <UL>
      
      <LI><I>Using vi editor and familiar with computer science
      department's computer facility.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>A little more about some of the Java classes.  More unix
      command.  Some simple problems that took me too long to figure
      out was compiling java source code when they are in two different
      paths.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I want to know about Java language and apply it into
      Web.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Nothing comes to mind... I don't feel like I was missing
      any special skills/knowledge.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More experience with GUI programming.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish to take course of GUI and networking.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Use java to do some funny stuff in internet.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Nothing in particular.  Aside from the fact that there is
      so much to learn about Java the Language.  [Is that like Jabba
      the Hut?]  I felt equipped enough to get through the
      assignments.  Oh wait, I'd like to knoe more about networking,
      security, cryptography, and web servers.  Maybe UML,
      too.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I'd know Unix, C++.</I></LI>

    </UL>

      <LI>What is the most important things you have learned in CS410J?</LI>

    <UL>

      <LI><I>Having broad knowledge of java to allow me to understand
      lots of aspects of java.  Having deep java programming skill to
      allow me to apply my learning in work.  (I understand I still
      have lots to learn.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Using and becoming familiar with some of the java
      classes.  Using the java API was help and being able to maneuver
      around unix.  I didn't have one particular one, I thought they
      were all important.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Understand the Java language.  It is great, I like the
      programs.  It makes me understand it more.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Apart from basic Java programming skills, a firmer grasp
      of solving programming problems using an object oriented
      approach.  Although I haven't started it yet, learning how to
      develop GUI applications should also come in handy.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Learning how to use javadocs and the libraries</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Many things you can do with Java (objects), OO-design,
      net, GUI</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I like this class very much.  Though many homeworks.  I
      learned what is abstract and interface do, what is some class
      has some build-in method like sorting.  In which just write the
      "comparable" and don't explicitly class it, but is works.  I
      believe I made good start in Java from this class.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>That Java is a very robust language, exciting, easy to
      work with if you know the rules and your way around the Java
      Docs.  There are <U>so</U> many classes and features.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I think it's OOP, and using Java is so easy and
      interesting.</I></LI>

    </UL>

      <LI>If you could give one piece of advice to someone taking this
      course in the future, what would it be?</LI>

    <UL>

      <LI><I>Take it.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>1) To be familiar with some of the java classes
      especially the ones in java.io, java.util, and java.lang.  2)
      Know how to compile java source code when you need source code
      from two different directories.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>If you want to know about Java, take Dave's class, it has
      very cool programs for you to learn, don't be scare.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Make sure you have some prior experience in the concept
      of object oriented programming (experience gained from CS202 was
      useful).  Start your program assignments early.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Make sure you are familiar with OOP.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Read a lecture before class, so it will be easy to
      follow.  Use reference material -- Java is too broad.  Start to
      do project in next day after class.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>This class covers wide range of Java concepts, provide
      many useful and easy-to-understand examples, class performance
      is good for helping student to get known about some thing which
      is looks hard to image.  Showing how to run some examples at
      class is good for me get immediate understanding and further
      follow up next lecture.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Bone up on <U>structured programming</U> and networking
      concepts.</I></LI>

      <LI><I> Pay attention to lecture and example codes, it will help
      alot.</I></LI>

    </UL>     

      <LI>What made you stay in this course?</LI>

    <UL>

      <LI><I>1) The curriculum, 2) Instructor knowledge of Java's
      latest technology and programming skill.  I had seen some
      professor using the same old material and not impressive
      programming skill.  3) The instructor's enthusiasm of teaching
      students.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I think java is a powerful tool and there is a lot of
      information on it.  Basically, I wanted to challenge
      myself.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>For my cs degree.  And I want to know What is Java?  Is
      it a good language to user?  How it different with others
      languages.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I felt like I was learning something useful.  The guy
      instructing the course was enthusiastic about the subject
      matter, and that enthusiasm tended to rub off on me.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I can use this now at work.  (Actually, need to very
      badly.)</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Power of Java.  I would probably use Java in my future
      work.  Interest in OO programming.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Can learn more useful Java knowledges.  Some homeworks
      are hard, fortunately there are some examples provided, I can
      manage to go on.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I want to learn Java well enough to use it in my job.
      Plus, it's an interesting subject and well presented.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I paid the tuition already. Moreover, this course is
      really interesting.</I></LI>

    <P>If you think that's bad, you should hear what my students said
    in the <A href="comments-spring2001.html">spring</A>.</P>
