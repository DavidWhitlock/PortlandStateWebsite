    <h1>Previously on CS399J...</h1>

    <p>I had a really awesome group in Winter 2007.  Here's what they
    had to say.</p>

    <ol>

      <li>What do you wish you had known before taking this
      course?</li>

    <ul><!-- One -->

    <li>I was somewhat familiar with the topics before taking this course.</li>

    <li>Better OO mental flexibility</li>

    <li>I would have liked to have more object oriented coding
    experience.</li>

    <li>JUnit testing -- wow.  This would have made the time shorter
    to cuento [sic] my projects if I could have integrated JUnit
    testing earlier on... It's a great tool!!!  JUnit testing is an
    in invaluable concept!</li>

    <li>My own limitations - ha, ha.  But really how much work/time I
    would need for it.</li>

    <li>How Java UI's are put together</li>

    <li>More Java</li>

    <li>Basic Java.  I started not knowing OOP and it was difficult
    learning both the OOP and Java at the same time.</li>

    <li>Surprisingly nothing.  This class is a perfect fir to my
    previous Java knowledge and experience.  This class improved my
    Java skills significantly.  I'm glad I've taken it.</li>

    <li>I can't really think of anything. I'd done enough doinking
    with Java that the first few lectures were review.</li

</ul>

      <li>What is the most important thing you have learned in
      CS399J?</li>

    <ul> <!-- Two -->

    <li>To start projects well ahead of due time</li>

    <li>The basics of the language and object hierarchy</li>

    <li>Mostly just getting back into the coding mindset.  I'm sure
    [it] will be a big help for my internship next term.</li>

    <li>JUnit testing.  The stuff with GUI, Swing, and AWT.  XML file
    stuff, SAX API, DOM API.  Server stuff: Serializable, sockets,
    ObjectOutputStreams, ObjectInputStreams.</li>

    <li>Objects -- this was the first time I had dealt with this many
    Objects and abstraction.</li>

    <li>Java UI Work</li>

    <li>How to use the javadocs</li>

    <li>Class structure of Java Programs.  The whole OOP concept has
    already proved to be valuable with the Alloy language in my formal
    methods class.</li>

    <li>Java is all about API.  Check the net before writing some
    program - the functionality you're looking for is likely to be
    already written and under GPL.</li>

    <li>Probably how crappy Java's XML support is. It's got to be the
    worst library I've used for parsing XML.</li>

</ul>

      <li>If you could give one piece of advice to someone taking this
      course in the future, what would it be?</li>

    <ul><!-- Three -->

    <li>To start projects well ahead of due time</li>

    <li>Allocate lots of time to studying and projects</li>

    <li>Be very mindful of your workload.  Expect to take maybe one
    other upper division CS class and that's it.  3 upper division CS
    classes including this is not reasonable.  (unless you don't mind
    eating, sleeping, and coding only!)</li>

    <li>Heavy on the project side, take a light load but take it
    before CS 321 and CS 322 -- compilers and languages.  However, I
    think it is doable to do 321 or 322 at the same time.</li>

    <li>Be prepared, don't procrastinate.</li>

    <li>Pay attention and start your work early</li>

    <li>Hit the ground running.  The assignments never let up.</li>

    <li>Spend time programming with Java before taking the class.
    Have time set aside for the programming projects.</li>

    <li>Know yourself, know your current Java programming level.  Read
    class web page, see example projects and decide if you're ready
    for the class.  Hint: if you think you're 70-80% ready, it's
    perfect fit to start the class.</li>

    <li>Start on the projects early and get them turned in ahead of
    time. The early ones are much easier than the later ones and you'll
    want the extra time.</li>

</ul>

    <li>What made you stay in this course?</li>

    <ul><!-- Four -->

    <li>I was interested in seeing and using technologies that we
    covered in class.</li>

    <li>Oh, I was very motivated to get as much as possible</li>

    <li>I knew I was going to get a lot of good programming
    experience, and get back into the coding mindset.</li>

    <li>Needed a code intensive class [to] practice my programming
    skills.  And an interest in really digging into the intermediate to
    advanced aspects of an OOP language.</li>

    <li>I paid money for it...and it is interesting stuff and useful
    the Java API.</li>

    <li>I like Java and I appreciate the structured flow of the
    course</li>

    <li>Every class I would learn something new (and I need the
    credit).</li>

    <li>The instructor with real-world experience.  The program
    assignments were geared for real-world work and not just
    theory.</li>

    <li>All projects were known ahead of time.  I read them and
    decided that those are things I want to learn.</li>

    <li>I knew enough about Java that it was relatively easy in spite
    of how long the projects took. That and I liked the way that the
    majority of the work is project driven.</li>

</ul>

    </ol>
