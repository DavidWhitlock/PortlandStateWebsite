    <h1>Previously on CS399J...</h1>

    <P>Another big class.  Lots of people with lots of opinions.</P>

    <OL>

      <LI>What do you wish you had known before taking this
      course?</LI>

    <UL><!-- One --->

      <LI><I>Not much attention to concepts...heads down programming
      examples.  Wish I had researched the programming language at a
      higher level</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Better Object Oriented Programming.  XML Class.  To get
      familiarized with JavaDocs.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Eat a heavy lunch, other than that I felt the course was
      pretty comprehensive.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Since Java is more and more popular.  I want to know some
      basic skill of Java that can make me feel good when I go to
      interview.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>My name</I> [There's one in every class...]</LI>

      <LI><I>Nothing.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I had known more about networking.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>A good command line parser</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I'd known more about UNIX since we spend so much
      time using it.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More about networking, so that I can enjoy learning the
      power of Network Java programming more.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More about UNIX.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Before taking this course I wish that I had known UNIX a
      little better, but I feel that I had a sufficient programming
      background to really get in Java otherwise.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Well, Java is similar to C++.  Since I already know C++,
      it seems that networking and security are new to me.  I wish I
      would have taken Networking class.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Class structure.  Understand the class object.  Know the
      Java documentation on your web site.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Nothing comes to ming expect I wish I would have known
      more about my work schedule, so I wouldn't have missed any
      classes.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I can write some programs of Java after finishing
      the class.  I did.  I can write Java programs!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>General stuff like the other program course.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I knew a little Java and a good deal of C++ coming in,
      I'm glad I did.  Pretty fast pace.  I think you teach a lot in 1
      quarter (This is good!)</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I had the simple knowledge of how to just compile
      a "Hello World" program.  And to understand the basic Java
      compile and run syntax.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to write a Java program.  How to use
      interface.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish to know how Java differs from C or C++ language.
      Also, I want to know my ability to learn different
      languages.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I could take this class with other non-programming
      class, so I can spend more time to student Java.  I have done
      the class's assignment pretty good, but I still want to learn
      more about Java.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I read the book about Java and XML before I take
      this course so that I don't have to suffer during this course.
      I also wish that I had better programming skill in C.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I had known that compiling/running command can get
      large and complex and that I was familiar with Ant.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I don't think anything is required for this course.  It
      would be useful if I knew more about networking.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I felt knowing C++ will help a lot in this
      course.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I have taken compilers and OS, I think that could
      have helped me.  Also I wish I have worked more with object
      oriented programming.  Also I wish I knew how tie consuming this
      class really is.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java programming because I have a java program before and
      the problem is I don't know java at all in the first time.
      After those project I can program in java but only some part
      that in assignment.  When I was this class, I think about learn
      to program the java in general and more detail.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I heard about Java, but I didn't know what does it mean,
      and also how does it use to write a program.  Thus, I wish to
      know this language and how strong it is used for.  I wish to
      learn about the concepts, also functions, classes,
      variables...used to write the program.  And how to compile and
      execute it.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More familiarity with UNIX environment (for group
      quizzes)</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Networking knowledge may help me in the last few
      weeks.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Not specially.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I think I did most of the prerequisites before this
      course like 4 courses on C++ and did in CS202 object oriented
      programming a little bit.  But I wish I had a good hold on OO
      programming.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More about networking and XML</I></LI>


    </UL>

      <LI>What is the most important thing you have learned in
      CS399J?</LI>

    <UL> <!-- Two -->

      <LI><I>Reflection...I think</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Capabilities of Java, its classes and methods, object
      oriented programming.  Java is cool, Dave is cool.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Programming to the interface, I haven't seen it
      emphasized as much in any books.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>We learn the concept in the class, but when we do the
      projects that is not enough, so I have to find some source.
      Solve problem by myself.  That improves my ability.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Object oriented programming basics, using functions,
      networking.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I better understanding of OOP.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I really liked the lecture on JUnit Testing.  That
      lecture will not only help me in Java, but with other
      programming.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Networked programming</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to write programs in Java!  Seriously, I think the
      most important thing I've learned is how to think in an object
      oriented fashion.  Java's 100 times better than C++ at being
      truly object oriented.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Expand my mind to a better OOP, than what I had in C++.
      I felt that I learned more about real-world program unlike the
      complexity of C++ where it is really hard to develop something
      useful.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>To use Java, which allows me to construct fairly complex
      programs relatively easily (especially when compared to
      C++).</I></LI>

      <LI><I>After taking so many courses in C++.  I still felt that I
      didn't have a firm grasp on object oriented programming.  After
      programming in Java and having all these objects and data
      structures made for me already, I really understood how object
      oriented programming works.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The most important thing is networking and
      security.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>A lot of things: Class structures (inheritance, creating
      object).  Networking in Java language.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The power of Java in terms of its portability and overall
      ease of use.  Also, Java networking capabilities.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>From my view, Java is better than C.  There are so many
      classes there: you can use them without knowing what's really
      going on.  Java gives error msg, which it is easy to follow and
      to find problems in you code.  In C, I sometime got lost from
      error msg.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Internet.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Programming procedures and ideology of Java
      programming.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Everything in Java is based on using a class.  Not every
      language is this way.  And to properly use method and syntax,
      then you must lookup the class involved.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to use class, exception, object and method
      overload.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The most important thing I have learned in CS399J is
      class and access to internet.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The most important thing I have learned in CS399J is
      object oriented programming in Java.  Java utilities for
      networking and security.  These concepts are interesting for
      me.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The most important thing I have learned in CS399J is the
      programming kill in Java.  I did not know that Java is also
      useful in networking and operating system.  Java is so much
      powerful than I thought.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The most important thing was realizing both the
      differences and similarities Java has to other
      languages.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to do networked programming.  I never did networked
      programs.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to document a program.  Have a plan before starting a
      program and the main thing is testing.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Object oriented programming.  Networking (still working
      on it).  Security.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>1. The java basic class such as Object, I/O, lang, and
      etc.  2. The technique in programming in networking, XML, and
      many thing from the project.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The most important thing I have learn in CS399J is that I
      can understand and use classes, objects, interface, to write
      code for a Java program.  Also, I like the way to use Java for
      XML and networking.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to navigate the JavaDocs and glean the info I needed
      from the quickly.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The powerful features in Java.  We strongly focused on
      how to use tools in Java, which is great.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java API, which is reliable, and which I do not need to
      know how it work.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>1. Dealing with Objects and using classes that some else
      created.  2. Networking and security and testing your own
      code.  3. RMI</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Programming to the interface!  Yes, I took this course in
      part to hopefully succeed in compiler class, but I did want to
      learn OO programming so P.T.I. practice is very helpful.  XML is
      kind of cool too.</I></LI>


    </UL>

      <LI>If you could give one piece of advice to someone taking this
      course in the future, what would it be?</LI>

    <UL><!-- Three -->

      <LI><I>Buy a book, maybe "Java for dummies" (not sure if they
      make this) that gives it you in lehmans [sic] terms.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Make sure to have good understanding of classes, XML
      language and object oriented programming.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Eat a heavy lunch.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Don't take some other classes that also needs a lot of
      time to do projects.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Be prepared to embrace the wonders of a modern computer
      language and experience the wonder of a language so well
      structured and documented that you may need no text.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Take a course that requires parsing before this, like
      operating systems, if they still require you to create a
      shell.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Keep up with the course.  The Homework piles up
      quickly.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Take it from D.W.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Look at the code samples on the web sit and pay
      <U>very</U> special attention to the command lines to compile
      and run the code.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Try to learn from this class as much as you can.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Don't forget to turn in the POA's.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Ask lots of questions if you are lost or confused!  I
      feel that is something I don't do and would benefit more from
      instead of trying to figure stuff out on my own.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>This class seems to be easy at first.  This class is time
      consuming.  One thing I would advise is consider carefully when
      taking other classes with CS399J.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Ready to have fun.  Spend a lot of time reading the
      lecture note and practicing the example of code.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Make sure to look at David's examples!  They will help
      you a lot when doing the projects.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Slow speaking speed a little</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Good lectures and examples.  Good program
      homeworks.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Learn to use and love Javadocs - and I think it's
      important to learn the benefits of using Java (and power) -
      learning about RMI and stuff like that, is, cool, but not a
      major deal to learn specifics.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Either look-up or ask someone to show you how to use an
      alias file for all those long Java compile and run lines of
      code.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Read the example in Dave's program.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It would be encourage CS student taking this class
      because they will learn many new things from CS399J and stay
      away from C or C++ language.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Stay with the class!  Try out the project assignment!
      Ask David for help!  And enjoy it!  It's fun!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Who want to take this class needs to read the book ahead
      of time in order to catch up because the instructor goes really
      fast to cover a lot of materials in one term.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Get familiar with packages in Java and the file structure
      as early as possible so you save time on projects.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Be familiar with networking terms although you will only
      do networking toward end of the term.  If you know how to
      program in any other language you can success in this
      class.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>If you like programming take this course.  You will enjoy
      it.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Don't wait until the last minute to work on the programs.
      Read lecture notes.  They help a lot to get the assignments
      done.  Spend some time playing around with the Java
      doc.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>1. Ask for more homework. Because, the home work will
      make more understanding and problem solve and familiar with
      java.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>My advice is that h/she should not feel hard, take it
      easy.  Try to discover and learn more.  Feel free to ask if
      she/he get stucks, and [illegible] to enjoy the class.  And ask
      for help any time.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Know you UNIX environment and be ready to spend some time
      learning the JavaDocs (okay that's two)</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It's not heard but sure needs a lot of works.  Don't take
      too many classes along with this.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Make the specification of lab very clear before starting
      coding.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Read lecture before coming to the class.  This is the
      most important thing I guess.  And before taking this course
      setup you Java machine and tools you want to use.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Make sure you understand how to use javac, packages, java
      options, and be able to run a program.  Ask during 1st three
      weeks or Dave gets pissed that you don't know it. </I></LI>


    </UL>     

      <LI>What made you stay in this course?</LI>

    <UL><!-- Four -->

      <LI><I>Keeps me out of the bar</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Never a doubt.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I found Java interesting.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I don't want to stop because once I chose this class I
      always want to conquer [sic] it.  To learn something new, not to
      waste money, and at the end, get my degree. </I></LI>

      <LI><I>I [heart] Java</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I enjoyed doing the projects.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I know I needed to learn Java this term so I could be
      prepared for compilers next term.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Interested in learning Java and OOP.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java is addictive!  I've really enjoyed writing this code
      once I got going.  Besides, it's great for the resume.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>My interest in learning Java.  Your teaching
      style.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>To learn more about Java (and I need this class to
      graduate).</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It might sound weird to a non-CS student but I really
      like to geek out in from of my computer for hours and hours and
      just code until my brain goes to mush!  And java is a pretty
      cool language to do that in.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I like to learn Java.  I love it.  The other thing is
      that CS321 (compiler) will be taught in Java.  So, I have to go
      through this class.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It's one of best course that I ever have.  I learned more
      than I expect and could imagine.  The lecture is so good and
      helpful.  The lab exercise is helpful.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It was just plain interesting and I was learning a great
      deal.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>If I work hard and spend time on it, I can handle this
      course.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I really feel learning things in this class. Get
      credit.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I need to graduate!  J-K [Just kidding], I really wanted
      to learn Java.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I was told that once I get use to the small differences
      of how Java compiles and runs code along with looking-up
      classes, I should start to feel comfortable to just write code.
      This is what kept me in the class.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I don't want to drop it. [Smiley face] The class is
      useful.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Learning XML and security in networking.  However, I
      really have heard time to implement the project and I think I
      will get an F grade in this class, but I often go to class to
      listen your lecture and discover the new things from
      you.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I'm really attracted by the beauty of Java.  I really
      like its networking oriented features.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I stay in this course because I need to learn Java for
      taking compiler classes next term so that I can graduate this
      summer.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Projects were fun and interesting.  Plus, I need to
      graduate someday :)</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wanted to learn Java for the compilers class.  It might
      also be helpful in the future when looking for a job.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I felt that as most of the points are based on projects
      and I had enough time to do the project.  I did OK in them.  So
      I never felt difficult to drop this course.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The topics were interesting.  The professor made the
      class fun, and interesting.  And I really need to learn Java to
      be ready for compilers.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>1. Java programming is interesting, I can do some project
      very easily when compare to other programming language.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I'm really interested in Java program.  And also, you're
      a very good instructor.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It was very interesting (learning Java that is) and gave
      on yet another take on Object Oriented Programming, as well as
      many other CS topics, without being too difficult or too much
      work (i.e. it was well paced).</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java is Really fun.  The projects are reasonable.  The
      instructor has good knowledge about Java (and a sense of humor
      too).</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Programming in Java is fun!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Learning more stuff.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Why would I not stay?  I paid for the friggin
      thing!</I></LI>
