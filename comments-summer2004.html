    <h1>Previously on CS399J...</h1>

    <P>This was the first time I taught CS399J in the summer.  I was
    thinking I'd have a nice, small section, but about 40 people
    signed up.  We covered a lot of material in 8 weeks.</P>

    <OL>

      <LI>What do you wish you had known before taking this
      course?</LI>

    <UL><!-- One --->

      <LI><I>Good understanding of the OOP concepts and details of
      basic Java would be useful to grasp the complete concepts of
      Java programming.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Better understanding of basic OOP concepts as applied in
      Java (inner classes, nested classes, to name a few).  Plus a
      greater familiarity with programming paradigms.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More experience with object orient programming
      techniques.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I had reviewed CS 202 before taking the classes.
      Especially, for the material that was covered in the first
      couple of lectures.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More about class paths and using Java packages.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I had a better background in Java. I took some
      Java at the U of O, but that was several years ago and I'd
      forgotten most of it.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Ant perhaps.  I felt pretty well-prepared for this
      class.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish that I had known how quickly the material moves
      and had started my assignment earlier.  Just a simple heads up,
      nothing at fault of the instructor.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Prior experience in applications programming.  The Java
      isn't hard, but using a toolkit like Swing -- both for the first
      time and with no knowledge whatsoever of its theory, design, or
      implementation -- is a major shock.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>GUI so I don't have to struggle on the last
      project.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More about how to compile and run Java programs that are
      in different directories.  Better understanding of
      packages.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I had known the course was necessarily Advanced
      Java, but more like beginner up to advanced.  I would have like
      to spend more time on a more advanced topics such as how to use
      reflection and Java beans.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Power ball numbers!  Actually, more GUI experience.  This
      was my first class that used GUI.  Portland State CS Dept is
      strange that way.  I would have liked to have had more time with
      GUI in this course.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It comes across in the course description as being much
      more difficult.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to use4 cygwin for compiling the last project.  I
      didn't have the time to figure it out at the end of the
      term.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I had know little more about Java before taking
      this course because the first two lectures moved so
      fast.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Learn Java, prepare for compiler.  Learn GUI, it's
      fun.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Programming in Java language</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Work hard!  Start to work on the project right after it's
      available on the instructor's web page.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Knowing more about UNIX would maybe be useful for this
      course.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I think I knew just enough after taking compilers (in
      Java).  It was a smooth transition from not knowing much to
      knowing the good basics of Java.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I didn't feel at any disadvantage due to a lack of
      knowledge regarding a particular field/concept.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I know about little about Java</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I had a little bit better UNIX background .  more
      specifically I wish I had known how to use an X-windows client
      and how to use make files and scripts to compile and submit Java
      code.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I had more exposure to Java GUI programming.  It
      is very different from both VB and ordinary (old) event driver
      programs.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The course description on the web said topics like XML,
      J2EE, RMI, etc. would be covered.  I didn't know that they
      wouldn't be included in the course.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>1) About the Arnold and Gosling text.  Had I read this
      rather than Eckel I would have been light years ahead of where I
      am now.  2) about the various doc websites for 1.4.2 as well as
      the Windows UNIX download site.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I would have know more about Java.  I cam into
      this class not knowing anything about the language except the
      basic stuff.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>A better foundation in programming.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Package in Java confused me on the first couple of
      programs, also hot the JVM works.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I knew more Java before I take this class.
      because last term I took CS322 (compiler) which is in Java and I
      had a tough time doing the programming assignments.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>This class teaches me everything I need.  I did well in
      CS161, 162, 163, 202.  So I am ready to enjoy this class.
      :)</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish to know basic Java programming, especially GUI
      programming.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More experience with OOP would have allowed me to
      organize my programs better.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I would have liked to learn "Ant" since compiling with
      make seemed kind of strange for Java code.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>A little bit about GUI programming in languages other
      than Java.  For example, C/C++.</I></LI>


    </UL>

      <LI>What is the most important thing you have learned in
      CS399J?</LI>

    <UL> <!-- Two -->

      <LI><I>OOP is the most important things I have learned and also
      got a good feel of Java.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>To do Swing really well, the full complexity of the API
      must be understood and put to use.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to find answers concerning Java API.  (Sun site) Java
      API docs.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java is fun, easy, and powerful!  I especially enjoyed
      the GUI stuff toward the end of the term, since it is left out
      of the core classes.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Basic GUI construction.  I have already used my new Java
      swing skills in another class.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I feel I got a better grasp of the power of object
      oriented design.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Fundamentals of Java.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I have learned how to use the API to figure out solutions
      and have begun to really understand the flexibility and overall
      structure of Java programming.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I've picked up information on how toolkits work and how
      to use them.  I've wanted this for a while, simply because I
      know others have done this better already.  Make is all more
      real.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Graphical User Interface.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Swing and GUI programming.  Very useful.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to use the command line tools and correct directory
      structure.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Interface implementation and class extension.  Getting a
      better understanding of object orientation and practice thinking
      in an object oriented manner.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Designing GUIs.  Learning how to use javadocs.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to maneuver through Java's object hierarchy.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to use GUI!  I also learned that making your
      code/program object-oriented from the beginning makes things a
      lot easier.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I've always wanted to learn how to program GUI
      applications.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to programming in Java.  Learn how to import class
      packages and utilities into Java.  Learned how to develop
      GUI.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Programming using API library and GUI</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The interesting of the course.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Using Javadoc API</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Learning how to use java docs was cool, but I'd have to
      say really learning how to compile forced me to grasp more of
      how Java works (classpaths , etc.).</I></LI>

      <LI><I>A more thorough understanding of Java, its libraries
      (API), and, most importantly, the distinguishing factors between
      Java and C++, and the situations and/or programming environments
      that a particular language would be better suited for.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The most important thing I have learned in this class
      about inheritance and Graphical interface user (GUI).</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to use the Java API documentation.  Object oriented
      programming especially the role and use of interfaces.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I value the smattering of JFC knowledge the most.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Doing assignments helps learn a lot of concepts we talked
      about in class.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>About Java in general and Java libraries.  Syntax,
      abstract as supported by abstract classes and interfaces.
      Compilation and execution details.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java is useful and actually do real-world things.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java is a very cool language.  It offers you a lot more
      options and help with the Javadocs.  If you need help with a
      class, you can check the docs online which helps a lot.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Programming in Java and especially designing GUI
      applications.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I think the GUI is the most important thing for me.  It
      makes the programming more fun because you can design the look
      and feel yourself.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I think the GUI is very useful.  The language I know such
      as C, C++ don't provide such functionality.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>After taking this course, I understand OOP clearly.  I'm
      confident saying that I know OOP now.  I know how to write a
      Swing application.  I've never write anything like that before
      (except VB). </I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to create object oriented programming using Java
      class, superclass, interface, abstract class.  How to build a
      GUI application.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Besides Java syntax the introduction to Java libraries
      and OOP were the most important things learned.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The true definition of OO programming.  This occurred
      when I first used the compareTo() and equals() methods to sort
      appointments in a TreeMap.  A few lines of code and the rest was
      done!  Cool.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I'll say the most important thing I learned is how to
      read the Java API document.  It provides flexibility when
      programming.</I></LI>


    </UL>

      <LI>If you could give one piece of advice to someone taking this
      course in the future, what would it be?</LI>

    <UL><!-- Three -->

      <LI><I>I would suggest to take this class only if he/she is
      serious and willing to learn Java.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Don't purchase the suggested text.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Do all of the homework to the best of your ability.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Enjoy the class, it is a lot of fun!  Take your time with
      the assignments as they requires some thought, but it is also a
      great opportunity to use what you have learned.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Make sure that you understand that the project continues
      to build on the last project for the full term.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Don't be afraid to ask questions and get to know the
      API.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Have a fundamental understanding of UNIX and don't ask
      tediously over-clarifying questions about assignments on the
      mailing list.  Have a lot of fun!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>To ask the questions that you think are stupid and
      configure out on you own.  It will save you a lot of senseless
      debugging.  And start the assignments early.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>See #1.  Go poke around and learn some about the basic of
      GUI-based programs.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Start working project ASAP so you could have sometimes to
      debug after you are done coding.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Make sure to understand how to compile and run programs.
      Don't just rely on some example.  Find out what each option
      means and how to use it properly.  Also take CS 202 before
      because it has some intro Java material.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Just because it's slow at the beginning, don't think the
      whole term will be that slow.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Get the Java SDK from Sun.  Go through the Sun
      tutorials.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Trust me about the sunscreen.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Don't wait till the night before to write a
      program.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Study your notes well before each class.  The quizzes get
      harder.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Each program is very time consuming, but all of them are
      well worth it.  So, don't try to finish each program in couple
      days.  Start programming early.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Good way to start for compiler.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Online Java doc API is going to be your best
      friend.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Take it from Whitlock!  Prepare to write code, and hope
      that you know C/C++.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>An introduction to object oriented programming, classes,
      and the notions of single inheritance is definitely
      important.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>If someone ask me about this course, I will advise
      him/her to take this course because it let we know about a lot
      object-orient and application on real world.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Start assignments early and familiarize yourself with
      sample code provided in Dave's home directory.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>They have to have a knowledge of Java object oriented
      programming.  The CS202 was just enough.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Instead of going through the lectures slide by slide,
      line by line, it would be interesting to make it an interactive
      class where the students participate and the instructor asks
      questions and vice versa.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Start the tutorials when time is available.  Start early
      on the projects.  Study the instructor-supplied examples.  (You
      choose.)</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Don't start working on the program the day the are due.
      The last two take much more work.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Start programs early, and make sure you read all the
      lectures notes and understand them because they are very helpful
      with the projects assigned.  I learned more in the first two
      lectures from you then I did all last term from my operating
      systems teacher.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Supplement the lecture notes with material from Java
      books like the one written by Arnold and Gosling.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Plan ahead when doing your program, and make sure to
      consider every special case for error.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>My advice is to read the class slides before go to class.
      It will make you understand better.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Study hard.  Spent all your time for the projects.  They
      pay off!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It will be time consuming and confusing in GUI
      application.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Use email to get help from Dave.  Also, download the Java
      class definitions from the Sun web site for quick (and frequent)
      reference.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Start learning this language as soon as possible.  Hey,
      it's free.  besides it forces you to think OO.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The projects of this class are fun.  So enjoy
      them.</I></LI>


    </UL>     

      <LI>What made you stay in this course?</LI>

    <UL><!-- Four -->


      <LI><I>The way course work has been structured and continuity of
      each concept with the next one is excellent.</I></LI>


      <LI><I>I was going okay until the last project, that is nothing
      was too rigorous conceptually.  The API is so well documented
      that I got by on the little knowledge I came in with.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Subject matter brought me into the course.  The
      instructor made it interesting and I needed the course
      credits.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The course material is exciting.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wanted to get to the GUI section.  It seemed
      practical.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It was fun, even though most of my programs didn't work
      very well...or at all.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Interesting material; lively instructor.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I learned a better understanding of a language in the course
      than I ever had before.  So I was excited at the prospect of
      how much I would get out of the course.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Curiosity, pure and simple.  You want to teach, I want to
      learn.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Great teacher.  I like the teacher a lot.  Great subject,
      especially the subject toward the end of the course.  I like
      GUI.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I needed the elective and I thought Java would be a great
      and necessary tool to put in my toolkit.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I needed the credits.  And it was a good refreshed for
      the Java i learned at PCC, and a better "more proper"
      methodology than I had taught myself doing Java programming on
      my own.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I need the credit hours.  Also I enjoyed the class.  The
      projects were well thought out, though I could have used more
      time on the last project.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java is really fun, can get a lot done quickly.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It's one of the few "practical" courses at PSU, that I
      can take and apply at work.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Besides Whitlock's humor, I wanted to learn GUI.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Each programming assignment were very interesting, and
      implementing GUI application to GUI application was very fun to
      learn.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I think learning Java is important for compiler class and
      also have more experiment to prepare for job.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I was learning and it was fun.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The material is great, I love programming in Java much
      more than C/C++.  Have, you made it great too.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>1. Fills an upper division CS req.  2. Java, in my
      opinion, is kind of a pioneer in managed programming languages.
      I work with C# a lot at work, and it's interesting to see where
      some of the language's ideas came from.  (Also, many classes in
      .NET have _very_ similar naming conventions to Java.)</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Because this course help me to understand a lot of thing
      in Java.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It was fun and very well taught.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I enjoy programming and the assignments were
      rewarding.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The assignments/projects were systematic: one followed
      the other and what we talked about in the class was used in the
      project which helper to learn better.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Am learning a great deal.  Need the credit to continue in
      the CS sequence.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It was very interesting and dropping class is not an
      option with financial aid anyways.  :)</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The class was good.  You were very understanding with my
      situation and you were very helpful with all the questions you
      got asked.  I learn from lectures not books and your lectures
      were very informative.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The organization of the lecture notes and the progression
      of the assignments.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Programming part is fun and challenging, and I did not
      feel lost after the first 2 weeks.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The programming assignment is very interesting,
      especially the last one -- GUI.  And the classes are fun
      too.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The challenge of the projects.  The nice instructor.  The
      course material.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>This class gives me hands-on experience in Java
      programming.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I needed to learn Java for work and because it was
      interesting.  Plus I needed the credits.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Last class I needed to graduate!  Seriously. Java is here
      to stay and it is one of the languages required to find a job in
      the market place.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>This class is fun and this class teaches ability to
      learn, not just teach you certain materials.  the class is also
      creative.</I></LI>
