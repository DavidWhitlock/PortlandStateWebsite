    <h1>Previously on CS399J...</h1>

    <p>More hot fun in the summertime learning Java.  Here's what my
    students thought of it.</p>

    <ol>

      <li>What do you wish you had known before taking this
      course?</li>

    <ul><!-- One -->

    <li>How to program a GUI. Or how to program in an enviorment other
    than PSU computers.</li>

    <li>I wish I had known really how much time was needed for the
    assignments. I wish I had some background with GUIs.</li>

    <li>I wish that I had more experience with Java before taking this
    class.</li>

    <li>more about guis. Anything more would have been helpful.</li>

    <li>How to run eclipse</li>

    <li>I need to have a good knowledge for UNIX</li>

    <li>more about other OS so it will help me with the projects</li>

    <li>#1 How much work was going to be required #2 Basic Java programming</li>

    <li>Nothing.</li>

    <li>I don't think there was anything else that could have prepared me.</li>

</ul>

      <li>What is the most important thing you have learned in
      CS399J?</li>

    <ul> <!-- Two -->

    <li>How to program a GUI. The stuff behind the scenes may be nice,
    but I think its important to have graphics to run it.</li>

    <li>The wealth of information one can learn from the online Java
    docs. I had read a few books on Java but there is so much more to
    the language than I thought.</li>

    <li>The most important thing I have learned in the course is never
    giving up, and keep doing it over and over again and again until I
    get it functioning fine.</li>

    <li>How to find out for myself what I want to know about the use
    of a new class</li>

    <li>The most important I have learned in this class is how to use
    JavaDoc</li>

    <li>good programming skills</li>

    <li>The Graphics object --> Java2D Shapes</li>

    <li>That each Java class requires a lot of study prior to
    implementation, and although interfaces are handy they require a
    lot of research before trying to implement any major one.</li>

    <li>anonymous objects</li>

    <li>I think the most important thing I learned was the GUI
    programing. in modern day computing that seems to be what most
    people want.</li>

</ul>

      <li>If you could give one piece of advice to someone taking this
      course in the future, what would it be?</li>

    <ul><!-- Three -->

    <li>Have a programming tool in your computer set up to program so
    when it comes time to program the GUI part of the class project
    you dont have to waste time trying to get something set up so the
    GUI will run</li>

    <li>The later assignments take more time than the first few
    assignments. Start early on the assignments. Ask for more examples
    on GUI programming- not necessarily about individual components
    but rather how one converts an existing application to a GUI
    application.</li>

    <li>Don't take this course during the summer time.</li>

    <li>For those with obligations outside of school, don't do it in
    summer session unless you can get a break from your outside
    responsibilities. There is a lot of 'drop everything and
    code'. While this works for some, it did not work for me.</li>

    <li>download eclipse to run your project</li>

    <li>take this class with a light load</li>

    <li>don't do the last project late .. it would be on the finals week</li>

    <li>Do not take this course unless it is the only difficult course
    for the term, i.e. other courses should require less than 8 hours
    a week in total to be successful.</li>

    <li>Either know eclipse or resign yourself to not learning it and
    use the cli tools.</li>

    <li>do your homework assignments early. I heard that advice at the
    beginning of this course and did that. I was glad I started early
    on all of them.</li>

</ul>

    <li>What made you stay in this course?</li>

    <ul><!-- Four -->

    <li>I liked learning more about Java and programming and the
    desire to learn about GUI's</li>

    <li>I learned a lot more about the Java language than I previously
    knew. It is good experience in case I pursue a future career as a
    Java programmer.</li>

    <li>What made me stay at the course is the fact that the quizzes
    became online and I did not have to go to the class. As it takes
    me about half an hour to get to the university and it is more
    convenient to watch the course online.</li>

    <li>I like java</li>

    <li>The content of the class is very good.</li>

    <li>it was interesting</li>

    <li>The clarity of the course .. I have taking other courses where
    I don't control my time the instructor will come at the end of the
    week and assign projects and that really missed my time
    schedule</li>

    <li>Simple, I need it, I need to complete my degree work so I
    functionally had no other choice.</li>

    <li>wanted to learn java</li>

    <li>I wanted to learn JAVA in depth. See if there were things I
    didn't already know about it. Which there were.</li>

</ul>

    </ol>
