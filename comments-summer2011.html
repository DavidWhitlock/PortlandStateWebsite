    <h1>Previously on CS410J...</h1>

    <p>Back to the old course number.  What did my students think?</p>

    <ol>

      <li>What do you wish you had known before taking this
      course?</li>

      <ul><!-- One -->

        <li>More about Maven, HTML, JUnit, GWT, working with servers in general</li>
        <li>More experience writing OO code</li>
        <li>More Java in general.  What I know was limited and learned over a year ago.</li>
        <li>How Maven works</li>
        <li>Web progamming.  Multi-threading programming</li>
        <li>A better introduction to the Java API and programming tols important in Java, such as exception handline</li>
        <li>More famliarity and practice in Java would have been nice.  I wish I had worked through your week 0 info before class</li>
        <li>I wish I had known to take this ealier in the CS cirriculum as it was very useful and provided many helpful tool</li>
        <li>More experience with Java build tools, command line stuff</li>
        <li>If anything at all, it would help to know a little bit of Maven. However, with the pre-configured archetypes, using Maven was cake.  Knowing any more Java or programming in general would have mande the course much too easy.</li>
        <li>How to use Maven -- I feel like there's stil a lot I wasn't able to pick up</li>
        <li>A little more about the Java tools we used so I didn't spend so much time exploring them during the class and I sish I kenw a bit more HTML/CSS before taking the course.</li>

      </ul>

      <li>What is the most important thing you have learned in
        CS399J?</li>

      <ul> <!-- Two -->

        <li>How to write a web application using GWT</li>
        <li>Two things:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Using interfaces and programming to them</li>
            <li>Usefulness of unit testing</li>
          </ol>
        <li>That I can figure this stuff out when I need to.  Oh, also GWT was great.</li>
        <li>How to use classes and methods that Java already provided.</li>
        <li>Web programming, depedency injection, GWT, testing with mock objects</li>
        <li>HTTP and RESTful programming</li>
        <li>I think there are two things  One was the hands-on work we had to do each week which really semenets the language in your mind.  Second was thebrief tasks [sic] of various topics to let us know what is available and we can follow up with later</li>
        <li>The most important thing i have learned in this course has been a more mature coding style that makes use of Java features but also uses abstraction and testing to make more robust and maintainable code.</li>
        <li>GWT/RPC/networking</li>
        <li>I wasn't very aware of dependency injection or reflection prior to this course, and will investigate them in more depth now :)</li>
        <li>Some cool Java language features and GWT</li>
        <li>How to test how to use Java tools to make development faster and easier, GWT, ad te importance of interfaces</li>
        </ul>

      <li>If you could give one piece of advice to someone taking this
        course in the future, what would it be?</li>

      <ul><!-- Three -->

        <li>Start projects early!  Task your time on the early projects since the later projects will build off of them.</li>
        <li>Really stop and think about a class before implementing it.  This saves a lot of work later on.</li>
        <li>Brush up on the Java and start the projects early!</li>
        <li>Don't try to reinvent the wheel (like create LLL from scratch).  Java is magic, use it to your advantage.</li>
        <li>Go to the lecture because the lecture is pretty useful</li>
        <li>Take at least one previous course where all the coding is in Java.</li>
        <li>Start early on projects</li>
        <li>Take this course early in the CS cirriculum and make time to get an early start on the assignments</li>
        <li>Start projects early and be prepared to use may different resources to learn and figure out problems</li>
        <li>Eat dinner <u>before</u> class :)</li>
        <li>It's a 400 level -- it's not easy just because it is Java!</li>
        <li>Brush up on web development and start GWT project early!</li>

      </ul>

      <li>What made you stay in this course?</li>

      <ul><!-- Four -->

        <li>Needed the credit, also finishing programs that actually did something useful was rewarding</li>
        <li>Well, the credits</li>
        <li>This is what I want to do -- develop Java apps, web aps, tied to a database (or cloud)</li>
        <li>I wanted to make web application.  In general this class taught me a lot and projects were fun.</li>
        <li>I enjoy programming!</li>
        <li>Desire not to fail</li>
        <li>Instructor and material</li>
        <li>The engaging lecture style, especially in the summer, made classes enjoyable.  The projects seemed useful and were in areas I had not worked with, specially file I/O, HTTP, and web aplications</li>
        <li>Networking/GWT sections were very practical.</li>
        <li>The class and professor are very different from the usual computer science options.  Also for the jokes.</li>
        <li>I'm probably going to end up as a Java dev when I graduate, and since that day is rapidly approaching, the class material is pretty relevant.</li>
        <li>Desire to become a more skilled developer</li>

      </ul>

    </ol>
