    <h1>Previously on CS399J...</h1>

    <P>My largest class ever.  More than 50 people had signed up.
    Phew!  And they had a lot to say...</P>

    <OL>

      <LI>What do you wish you had known before taking this
      course?</LI>

    <UL><!-- One --->

      <LI><I>I wish I had known about networking and computer
      security to learn this course better.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Nothing really, I felt that I've got an knowledge of
      what I expected.  I fell that using references I can build onto
      what I have learned.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I would have known that we need somewhat strong
      programming.  Those assignments are hard (not too hard) but I
      need to spend lots of time for that.  Luckily, I didn't take
      hard classes this term, but if I did, I might not follow this
      class.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java, gui programming so I could show off</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I had a better command of UNIX and its shells</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Knowing the very basics of Java would have helped.  One
      of my biggest problems early on was how to set up paths for
      packages and compiling.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>A little more about network programming, but really this
      course covered all the basics so CS 161/162 probably would have
      been sufficient.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>UNIX :( Not knowing it really screwed me throughout the
      course.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I was well-prepared for this course.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Basics of networking, RMI</I></LI>

      <LI><I>If I knew a little more about networking my grasp of what
      is going on in the .net API, and what can be done with it might
      be a little less tenuous.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Nothing before the class, but I kept forgetting to study
      for the quizzes.  I wish I hadn't.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The beginning stuff.  I wish I had <U>some</U>
      rudimentary concept of an API & how to use other's
      code.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More basics about UNIX and more about networking</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Why monkeys smell funny?  The course level was good, and
      it built nicely so my previous knowledge was adequate.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to use Ant and JUnit</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I don't know how to answer this...the course provided
      everything needed.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Well Dave...I think you know this already!  I wish that I
      was familiar with the UNIX environment!  However, struggling
      through it for the first time is a key step in learning
      something.  Thank you for allowing me to struggle through
      it.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to use Javadocs.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Nothing.  Couldn't think of anything.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Many many UNIX commands.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java.  :) Where to find a good parking sport at 5 PM on
      campus.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>At first I think about the quizzes, but about 1/2 of them
      is not even Java related subject so it is OK.  Especially the
      1st quiz.  I had not programmed for a while so a little bit
      shock.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>That I could have taken the class sooner.  I really
      enjoyed the course, learned a lot, and wish that there were more
      like it offered at this university!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to debug Java programs.  I know how to use gdb
      but...</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More about networking</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Object oriented programming methods</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More about the Java classes</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Little background about Java before taking this course.
      Then I don't have spend time to read Java book.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to program in Java, write Java applications and the
      GUI</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I honestly can't think of anything.  My previous
      experience/education in programming and light Java experience
      prepared me more than adequately.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I had known a little Java language to/in order
      prepare for the class.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java APIs and how to really use them</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to use Ant</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to read Javadocs.  How to compile Java code.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>UNIX.  Basic background of networking.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Nothing much, it's pretty straightforward</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Besides Java?  That the programs are time consuming and
      not to take a heavy work load.  I was warned, though.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>A little bit of Java and XML</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Many people had different ideas about Java.  I took this
      class to experience it myself.  I now know a little about Java
      to compare with language I knew!  I wish hat I had knowledge
      about network before so I could have better understanding about
      it!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>There's going to be an oral part on the final?</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I had known XML language</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Who the one-armed man was who killed the doctor's wife</I></LI>

      <LI><I>My father's name!  Daddy?</I></LI>

    </UL>

      <LI>What is the most important thing you have learned in
      CS399J?</LI>

    <UL> <!-- Two -->

      <LI><I>The most important thing I have learned in CS399J is
      learn coding in Java.  Also use Java language to write XML file.
      Especially, currently we're learning something really
      interesting is Java network.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java...didn't know anything when I started.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>All of the lecture that we did.  I didn't know about
      Java, before I took this class, even though Java is a similar
      (not same) to C, they are some difference that I should
      know.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java, I liked the networking the most.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Program to the interface</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The Java language I think</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The importance of getting the early stages of a large
      project done correctly and on time.  Also design and
      planning.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to program in Java</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Implementing threads in a micromouse robot simulation
      program I wrote would have helped the UI -- so maybe how to
      implement different threads is the most important thing -- but
      there's probably something more useful I'm not thinking
      about.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>OOP, actual OOP, not what you attempt to do with C++</I></LI>

      <LI><I>This is a really powerful language: This language is
      almost like the concrete instantiation of everything which has
      been learned or done in the last 40 years of CS.  If you learn
      an API you learn something bout a general field as
      well.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Using classes & data abstraction</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The versatility -- I would have assumed that Java does
      what some of the other languages do, but it appears to encompass
      them all.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to program in Java</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java in general.  Probably interfaces.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Good object oriented programming skills.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Probably the examples of how/what you consider
      "programming to the interface"</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Well, the XML information is very interesting.  I really
      am interested in all of it.  Since I had never programmed in
      Java before, it was all very new and exciting.  I will have to
      look more closely at Java security.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Programming to the interface</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Learned XML and DOM structure.  I thought this was very
      useful in creating databases.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to work with jar files</I></LI>

      <LI><I>See above [parking spot].  Seriously, the most important
      thing is probably a sense of understanding Java: of knowing that
      I've been exposed to the basic concepts.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to program in Java and learn about OOP</I></LI>

      <LI><I>An overall understanding of the Java language and OOP.  I
      have had OOP concepts brought up in other courses.  However,
      unit this course I did not fully understand the usage and
      relevance.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Sorry, but this is really just another language class.
      Aside from some interesting bits about Java this class didn't
      teach me anything "important".  A better question would have
      been "...the most interesting thing..."</I></LI>

      <LI><I>That Java is now my favorite programming language</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Learning to use Java APIs, which makes programming in
      Java really productive</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to program in Java & understand how Java work with
      server/client</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The most important thing I have learned in CS399 about
      inheritance in Java and XML.  Also about the server.  But I was
      behind in the class.  Then I have to catch up.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How powerful object-oriented programming is.  How useful
      Java can be!  Networking, program to the interface, code
      reuse.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How adept Java is at handling objects</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The most important thing I learned from this class is
      Java language, specifically security topic.  I could say
      networking.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Object oriented programming</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java Rocks!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Working with other people's code</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Programming in Java</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java sockets, network programming, serializable</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Differences between this and C++.  The basics of the lang
      and anything else that will help me through compilers.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Programming in Java</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I know how to write program in Java programming language.
      I had more experiences in debugging programs.  I learn a NEW
      language!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The most important thing I have learned networking
      working with Java.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java ins & outs.  I have a much better understanding of
      object-oriented programming.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>A better understanding of OOP (or was it POOP?  I'm
      confused.)</I></LI>

    </UL>

      <LI>If you could give one piece of advice to someone taking this
      course in the future, what would it be?</LI>

    <UL><!-- Three -->

      <LI><I>The advice to someone who will take this class in the
      future is they should get to know/or learn some networking and
      operating system before taking this course.  It will be
      helpful for them.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Don't take other heavy programming classes at the same
      time, you'll end up spending more time than necessary on the
      Java assignments, just because they are fun.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I would say that he should not take any time-consuming
      class because he will spend lots of time for this.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Keep up with the projects</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Watch out for the XML assignment that one seems to be the
      hardest so far.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Go to class you schmucks!  :)</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Start on the POA right away.  Begin programming early and
      submit early.  Be courteous and helpful to others.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Make sure you know UNIX!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Make sure you sign up for the email list.  Otherwise you
      may miss advance notice on quiz questions.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Start your programs ASAP</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Test anything that could go wrong, start early on
      programs.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Because the workload -- study his code</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Have more knowledge about UNIX and networking</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Take it before you take compilers.  Stay up on the
      homeworks, they can easily bury you.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Do some of the tutorials online -- at least get some sort
      of Java programming under your belt.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Have a good idea of how to do robust command line
      parsing.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Well...Maybe once...the lecture was going like
      <B>light-speed</B> and I was like...Hmmm...But it was really
      good for the most part.  Oh year...For in the in-class
      projects...maybe some setup notes or I don't know.  I think you
      PDF format slides are awesome.  I like the way you put 4 slides
      on a page...so I'm not flipping through 1000's of pages to find
      information.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>To hack all the example code to make it work for what
      they need.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Ask a lot of questions over mailing lists.  This helps A
      LOT!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It's a very fun class!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Know/learn UNIX</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It is flexible in compare to other classes.  I was warned
      before taking this class that it is very heavy but I think it is
      not that bad.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>"Sign up for this course!"</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Start assignments as early as possible and test them
      until the computer bleeds.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Look first at Dave's code and understand it before coding
      your projects</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I would like to advise them to start working early on
      their programming assignments.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Head start on the program</I></LI>

      <LI><I>If I give advice to another student about this class, I
      tell them they need to read Java book and understand syntax and
      the way Java work.  That way it much easy for them when they
      start doing the program.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>"You're making the right choice."</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Start assignments as soon as they are given, some things
      can take longer than you expect to get working.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I would say take this class and apply to their career or
      reference, because it helps a lot if that person learns more
      about web.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>You'll be busy</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Keep up with the projects</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Read the notes before asking questions.  Start projects
      early.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>You need a lot of time for this course.  Projects will be
      assigned almost every week.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Always give a courtesy flush after eating polish sausage
      and beer the night before it in a public restroom.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Spend time reading reference material</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Keep up on the programs...and beware of the extra hard
      quizzes and final.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Start the project early and don't wait to the last minute
      to start.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Listen to lectures and read it over again.  Spend time in
      doing projects!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Have a good programming background</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I will tell that person spend a lot of time for the
      homework.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Pack your kleenex, this class is <U>intense</U>.  You'll
      laugh, you'll cry, you'll come out of it as a much more
      productive member of society.</I></LI>

      <LI>What made you stay in this course?</LI>

    <UL><!-- Four -->

      <LI><I>I want to learn more & deeply in Java.  And also there
      are some interesting topics are XML and networking which I
      really want to learn.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Need to be full time, couldn't drop out even if I wanted
      to...which I didn't.  It was fun!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Well, I could make this because I have time (I am part
      time in this term).</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Interesting topic and good teacher</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I need 8 credits to graduate, and am taking 8 credits.
      Java is also a useful skill to know.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Nothing really made me want to leave.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>All the grades I was getting on my projects.  :)</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Wanting to learn Java.  Your light-hearted, humorous
      approach to teaching.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wanted to learn more about Java.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Surprisingly enough it was a fun class</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It was really enjoyable.  I liked it.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I enjoyed the programs.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I want to be Mr. Smarty Pants about everything</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The desire to learn Java</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Wanted to learn Java.  Want to graduate before I'm 30 :)
      Seriously, I should be a doctor.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It's quaint charm.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It was fun and exposed me to Java topics I wouldn't have
      looked into otherwise.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Well...your encouragement helped a lot.  I certainly felt
      overwhelmed for the most part and you showed incredible patience
      and willingness.  You are one of the first instructors I have
      had that does things exactly as I would -- you actually want the
      student to learn something.  Somewhere...that gets lost by most
      professors.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The jokes & stories that are told.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The materials were relevant and applicable.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wanted to learn as much as possible about Java
      programming.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I'm using Java at work</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I enjoy the programming part and want to learn new
      programming language.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I enjoy your teaching style, humor, and found the
      assignments beneficial.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Honest answer: I want my degree.  Best answer: It's more
      fun than the Psy class I have to take.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Very instructive and fun</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It is really fun class.  I like the subject matter and the
      instructor's teaching methods.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Server and client network stuff</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I want to learn new language.  Also I need it for
      compiler.  New learn language always the best thing every
      student wish.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The materials are very interesting and the instructor is
      smart and also fun at the same time.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It taught valuable skills in OOP and Java and it was
      really fun.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I would say because I need this course because this will
      help me for my career and understand or even for my
      skills.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I'd like to graduate before 65</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The cool teacher</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It's fun and not too hard.  Enjoy learning a new
      language.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It is too far to go back now.  (The last project is very
      difficult, by the way.)</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It was enjoyable and I needed the credits</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I was held at gun point!  Wanted to learn the
      language/material.  Unlike most of the courses in
      college.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The lecture is fun and useful, plus we have quiz
      everyday</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I learned good stuff & have fun in doing project.  The
      class environment is also fun!  The instructor had a sense of
      humor!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Need the credit, it was easy.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I think Java is the powerful language so, which made me
      stay in this course.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Other than I need the credits to graduate, Dave is a
      snappy dresser!!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The course material and the instructor</I></LI>
