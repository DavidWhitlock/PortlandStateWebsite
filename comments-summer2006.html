    <h1>Previously on CS399J...</h1>

    <p>Hot fun in the summertime.  We had another exciting round of
    CS399J, but since it was offered in the summer, the class was kind
    of small.  Luckily, their comments weren't.</p>

    <ol>

      <li>What do you wish you had known before taking this
      course?</li>

    <ul><!-- One -->

<li>I wish I had known more about exceptions and scopy issues.</li>

<li>Nothing else.</li>

<li>Better understanding of Java, and some exposure to Java's GUI
APIs.</li>

<li>I wish I had known more about the reads and writers.</li>

<li>To learn how to program in Java "confortably", i.e. learn the
basics in Java programming.  I also wanted to learn how Java is used
to create and develop web applications.</li>

<li>I wish I was more familiar with Java lanaguage.</li>

<li>It was only my second programming class since 1992.  Fortunately,
it is also my last programming class needed to graduate with a
computer engineering degreee.  I expected this and there is nothign I
wish I had known.</li>

<li>I had taken some Java before, but this definitely filled in a lot
of holes.  As far as if I wished I had known anything before...I can't
really think of anything.</li>


</ul>

      <li>What is the most important thing you have learned in
      CS399J?</li>

    <ul> <!-- Two -->

<li>I learned that a language like Java depends strongly on the APIs
and that the APIs are teh source to go to when you have
questions.</li>

<li>An understanding of object oriented programming</li>

<li>Broad (large) knowledge, foundation of Java, searching for API and
flexibility of Object Programming.</li>

<li>The most import and thing I've learned is how to use GUIs.  I had
always just ehard about it, but no on ever really explained it to
me.</li>

<li>The "design structure" of Java Programs.  Java is basically a
group of objects working together, and each object (class) has its own
purpose.</li>

<li>How the Java language is organized.  Class hierarchy.  How to use
the different classes.  Mustn't forget how Exceptions are used.</li>

<li>I learned that even an old engineer can learn Java.</li>

<li>Exceptions!  Didn't fully grasp them, but its all starting to come
together now.</li>


</ul>

      <li>If you could give one piece of advice to someone taking this
      course in the future, what would it be?</li>

    <ul><!-- Three -->

<li>To always look at the assignments again when you have trouble
because there are usually pointers there that you probably looked at
and "oh yearh sure" the first time -- but HELP the eecond time.  Also
reviewing the notes wields more infro fore the assignments than you
might expect.</li>

<li>Start projects early</li>

<li>Carefully reviewing handouts and homework assignment before
starting your program assignment.</li>

<li>Know Java beforehand</li>

<li>If you want to learn Java programming, then take this course.</li>

<li>Overview the Java language make sure you can write simple
programs.  Be familiar with the Javadocs on Java Language.</li>

<li>Know Unix</li>

<li>I am sure many have said this, but... DON'T PUT OFF THE
PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENTS.</li>


</ul>

    <li>What made you stay in this course?</li>

    <ul><!-- Four -->

<li>Excellent presentation along with interesting topics.</li>

<li>Projects were good practice</li>

<li>Instructor and projects</li>

<li>It was only once a week, and I wanted to learn about GUIs.</li>

<li>I found this course satisfying my expectations in learning
Java.</li>

<li>Learning the Java language, I found some of the features Java
provides are excellenet, for making certain programming task
easier.</li>

<li>I graduate at the end of next term.  Not staying the course would
have been unthinkable.</li>

<li>Very interesting material.  Just wanted to keep learning.</li>


</ul>

    </ol>     

    <P>Can't get enough comments?  There are lots more <A
