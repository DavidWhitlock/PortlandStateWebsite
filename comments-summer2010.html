    <h1>Previously on CS399J...</h1>

    <p>After ten years, how did we do?</p>

    <ol>

      <li>What do you wish you had known before taking this
      course?</li>

      <ul><!-- One -->

        <li>I wish I&#39;d known a bit more about jar/war files, command line parsing, web containers, client/server specifics, REST services, GWT and more about integrating the tools necessary to use some of these features on common IDEs. Lots of cryptic error messages that came up really made it difficult to make consistent progress on the last projects.  </li>
        <li>There was no surprise.</li>
        <li>*how to use an IDE better. (vi could&#39;ve worked well if i was more prepared i suppose- with all the maven/jetty/gwt terminal stuff)<br/>*i wish i know how to use maven properly before class. <br/>*i wish i had SOME experience with networking with java (jetty stuff)<br/>*that there were no outlets in the classroom.</li>
        <li>I wish I had been more proficient using Eclipse (I&#39;m better now).<br/>Even more, I wish I were a Maven &quot;god&quot;. There is so much to learn about that powerful tool.</li>
        <li>More about maven.</li>
        <li>I took most if not all of the CS required course, so not sure what to list.  However, an advice to future students would be CS300 (actual OOP program from analyze user requirements to working OOP program), or CS321 &amp; 322 (Compiler where Professor Mark Jones have us implment a Mini Java Compilier (MJC)).  </li>
        <li>It certainly would have been easier to ramp up if I had done more programming in the previous 6 months, or if I knew maven beforehand. <br/><br/>I can&#39;t complain, though--I got settled in after the first 2 weeks,  and I&#39;ve learned a lot. </li>
        <li>Maven, subversion (or other CMS), more comfortable with my IDE (Eclipse, then NetBeans)</li>
        <li>A little more about the IDEs available. Otherwise, nothing.</li>
        <li>I wish I had had previous experience with the IDE and especially Maven, as I wasted a lot of time figuring out the tools before being able to start any real &quot;work.&quot;</li>
        <li>I wish we had access to more resources.  </li>
        <li>Better understand about Java, and know more about Eclipse, Maven, etc.</li>
        <li>I feel that I was relatively well prepared for this course, and nothing comes to mind immediately.</li>
        <li>I wish I had known more about Rich Internet Applications with Java.  Having more background with Maven and JUnit would also be helpful.  There were several things that were knew to me and it seemed to take twice as long as I hoped to be able to apply these technologies.</li>

      </ul>

      <li>What is the most important thing you have learned in
        CS399J?</li>

      <ul> <!-- Two -->
        <li>I have learned much from the course but some of the main things include:<br/>1) real world expectations of programmers/developers<br/>2) the importance of testing everything as you develop<br/>3) how to use great build tools like Maven/Ant with IDE&#39;s like Eclipse to speed up the development process<br/>4) how to implement client/server software at a basic level and work with Tomcat/Jetty containers<br/>5) I was also exposed to many other types of frameworks commonly used in industry through doing much research on each project<br/><br/>There are many other things that I learned but these are among the top of my list.</li>
        <li>Maven, and GWT</li>
        <li>There are so many- documenting code, more efficient coding, i learned that class is nothing like the real world. and procrastinating is like shooting yourself in the leg. and if you don&#39;t know something, you&#39;re not the only one. <br/>save, save, save, test, test, test.<br/>I will never use eclipse. </li>
        <li>Beyond greatly improving my Java skills, I have learned a huge amount about using the many tools that enable effective Java programming and development.</li>
        <li>The JUnit framework and how to document your code well. JUnit is a life saver.</li>
        <li>All the neccessary tools and their interrelationship to build a real world program using Java.  Not so much of Maven, but Eclipse IDE and Google Web Toolkit.</li>
        <li>That is a tough question. I would say this is divided between learning about REST / HTTP / servlets and learning about Maven. I never had a formal introduction to REST prior to this class, so learning about it made me more confident as a web developer. Servlets are no longer so mysterious, nor are web.xml files. <br/><br/>Maven is important, because I like that it handles your project without too much abstraction. When I create a web project using an IDE, I have no idea where all the different files come from--which are IDE dependent, and which are part of the core project&#63;&#63; I especially hate Visual Studio for this reason. With Maven, you can easily customize the project using your pom.xml file, and I find it helps me to learn about the structure of various projects i.e. webapps and servlets.   </li>
        <li>How to implement web services (either REST-ful or via GWT)</li>
        <li>Using maven and junit. It was probably the first section that was discussed that I was unfamiliar with. Both of them combined make developing more streamlined.</li>
        <li>Working with the servlets and GWT.  I&#39;m still trying to figure out GWT, but I can see how this is a great tool for developing Internet-based applications.</li>
        <li>The practice programming was most important.  </li>
        <li>REST, and GWT.<br/>Also learn a lot about JAVA which is a popular programming language.</li>
        <li>Maven, JUnit, and how to put together a relatively robust development environment are the most broadly useful things I learned in this class.</li>
        <li>I have learned how important testing can be to your development.  It saves so much time if you write the tests before writing your code.  It also help me understand why I was doing what I was doing.  Also I am so grateful to have spent some time with Google Guice and GWT.  There are amazing and will help me so much with the work I am doing.</li>
      </ul>

      <li>If you could give one piece of advice to someone taking this
        course in the future, what would it be?</li>

      <ul><!-- Three -->



      </ul>

      <li>What made you stay in this course?</li>

      <ul><!-- Four -->
      </ul>

    </ol>
