<h1>All About My Homepage</h1>

<p>Coming from a compilers background, web design was never really my
thing.  Sure, I learned HTML in 1996 back when we thought it was going
to make us all millionaires, so I knew enough to put together a
reasonable looking homepage for my class at PSU.  I tried to make it
useful and my students seemed to appreciate having access to course
material online.  Lately, though, my career has taken me through web
land and I've come to appreciate things like <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/">HTML</a>, <a
href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference">JavaScript</a>,
and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/">CSS</a>.  So, I decided
it was time to spiff up my PSU homepage and show off some of the more
interesting things I've learned.</p>

<p>The first thing I tackled was the overall design of the page.  I
wanted to replace the single column of flowing data with three
columns: links on the left, the course information in the center, and
some fun stuff on the right.  I went looking on the web for some
examples of doing three column layout with CSS.  At first, I
experimented with the <a
href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/negativemargins">"negative
margins"</a> layout from A List Apart, but I decided to go with the <a
href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/holygrail">"holy grail"</a>
layout because it was newer and used fewer divs.  Not surprisingly, it
took some fiddling to get the column widths to be appropriate for my
content, but overall I think it looks pretty good.  You can see the
final CSS <a href="css/3col.css">here</a>.</p>

<p>One of things that I've wanted to add to my homepage for years is a
list of books that I've read and recommend for my students.  While I
do not believe that you can learn to be a good software engineer just
by reading a book, there are a lot of good books out there that can
help you develop your skills and expand your technical horizons.  A
friend of mine had a link to <a
href="http://www.librarything.com/">LibraryThing</a> on his blog and I
thought it would be a cool way to list my books.  (Yes, LibraryThing
links you to amazon.com.  Buy your books from <a href="">Powell's</a>
instead.)  I also added a link to my <a
href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> profile so that former
students can keep in touch with me.</p>

<p>The main content of my homepage is the course description and
schedule for CS399J.  Even though this information is doesn't change
much, I always found it to be kind of a pain to edit the HTML when
preparing for the term.  Adjusting all those list items and hyperlinks
was sometimes error prone.  I wanted to separate out the data being
displayed (what lectures and assignments were given on each night)
from the display itself (all those list items).  Unfortunately, HTML
doesn't allow content to be split up across multiple files easily and
my pages are not generated programmitcally.</p>

<p>I've always had some JavaScript on my homepage, but it was limited
to the cutesy quote at the top.  I realized that I could use
JavaScript to add some snazzy, and hopefully useful, functionality to
the page.  To solve the problem of separating the content from how it
is rendered, I used AJAX to asynchronously fetch the course data from
the server.  The &lt;body&gt; of my homepage has an onload function
that requests a static file containing <a
href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> code.  JSON, the JavaScript
Object Notation, is a textual representation of JavaScript objects in
which I represented the <a
href="js/schedule-summer2007.json">content</a> of a term of CS399J.  I
wrote some JavaScript code that traversed the object read from JSON
and inserted <a
href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Gecko_DOM_Reference">DOM</a>
elements into the page.  You can see all of the code <a
href="js/schedule.js">here</a>.  I also added the ability to expand
and collapse a given week's content.  Most people will probably just
scroll down the page, but a week will automatically collapse if the
term is current underway and the week has already passed.  That way
students won't have to scroll past information we have already
covered.</p>

<p>To help me out in all of this, I used the <a
href="http://www.prototypejs.org">prototype</a> JavaScript library to
perform the AJAX call and convert the JSON data into JavaScript
objects.  prototype adds a whole bunch of useful functionality to
JavaScript's core classes (like String and Element) which is easy to
do in JavaScript (unlike Java in which you can't add methods to
classes without changing the source code).  I also used a third-party
library for <a
href=http://www.javascripttoolbox.com/lib/date/index.php">date
formatting and parsing</a>.</p>

<p>Along the way, I developed and tested my homepage using the <a
href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> web browser
with the <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">FireBug</a> and <a
href="http://www.kevinfreitas.net/extensions/measureit/">MeasureIt</a>
plugins.  Don't leave home without them.  Of course, I also had to
spent some time accounting for the differences between Firefox and
Internet Explorer.  All of the files were edited in emacs (old habits
die hard) on my MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Enjoy,</p>
