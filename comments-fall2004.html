    <h1>Previously on CS399J...</h1>

    <P>I decided to make this term a little more difficult.  We
    covered the Java programming language, object-oriented
    programming, XML, GUI programming, and networking.  Here's what
    my students thought about it.</P>

    <OL>

      <LI>What do you wish you had known before taking this
      course?</LI>

    <UL>
      
      <LI><I>I wish I had known more about packaging.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It would have helped to know about javadocs & Sun's
      website.  I would have read ahead.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I had know about the serializable
      interface.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I feel that this course would have been more enjoyable if
      it were split into two terms.  The GUI and Networking being the
      second term.  I wish that I would have done more review on this
      subject.  I also should have practiced programming since it has
      been a year without a CS class.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How flexibe and easy to use Java was.  If I had to be
      more technical I wish I understoof packages claspaths for Java
      better.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Lean more deeper in Java language other than just focus
      on the program structure.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I woudl have taken Dave's advice and eaten dinner
      before the first class.  I got hungry!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More information on OOP.  Subtyping?</I></LI>

      <LI><I>That 3 hour classes seem like a 100 years even when one
      is very interested in the subject.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish that I understood the basic of approaching Java.
      The language is not bad but it's quite different from other
      languages that I have taken.  I also wish that I had more
      experience with unix (directories) before taking the
      class.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More about design patterns.  I think I could have written
      better designed projects.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to use IntelliJ  ;)</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish that I had know the Java library better to do the
      coding.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>At least a little Java programming experience.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Graphical user interface.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>If I really wants to learn everything then take only this
      course.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I've known XML before this class.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>A little knowledge about Java.  Just coded two program in
      CS202.  But the style is like C++ coding without exceptions,
      etc.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to work with MDI!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More about GUI layout managers.  I/O and how the
      different classes relate.  (I'm still fuzzy on this.)</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More Java, so the concepts wouldn't be so new to
      me.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Nothing really.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>This course covers the basics.  So, I'm good to
      go.</I></LI>

    </UL>

      <LI>What is the most important things you have learned in CS410J?</LI>

    <UL>

      <LI><I>I've learned how to use Java API and get useful info from
      it and also XML (as little as it was).</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Basically how object-oriented programming works.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I learned that Java is really cool and most of all I
      learned more about GUI programming.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How much fun Java makes programming.  In most other CS
      classes I dredid [sic] the projects, but on this one (even
      though it was overwhelming) I wish I had more time to make it
      all work (and probably will continue on these after the
      classe).</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I had never used Java in such a high level way.  Such as
      XML, graphics.  The extensive and easy to use API help clarify
      why Java is a very useful language.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>To handle a big project, have to get the previous done
      before start doing the next one.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>XML parsing with SAX and DOM.  XML is becoming so
      pervasive that it almost seems like required knowledge.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to separate a problem into different parts, and then
      combing them to create a solution.  This makes code easier to
      develop and maintain.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Well, learning how to be more comfortable writing large
      amounts of code and dealing with data manipulation.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I got a pretty good idea of how Java works.  I can say
      that I've seen the light when it comes to Java programming
      language.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to do basic GUI programming.  It is a hole in my
      education that needed to be filled.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Probably the GUI stuff since PSU doesn't cover that in
      required courses.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Now I've learned about doing GUI.  Which is the stuff I
      wished to know all along.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>XML or GUI</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Up to this point, it's GUI using Swing</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I learned most of basic topic of Java and also did
      project, so it was helpful to understand concept of
      Java.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Everything I learn in this class is important.  I like
      the GUI program.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The program coded in Java language using exceptions and
      the GUI programming which interested me a lot, and XML.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to work with MDI!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>GUI programming.  I learned SO much from writing all the
      programs.  THe volume of homework forced me to learn Java a lot
      better.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java could be fun, but it could also be painful!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Know how to code in Java.  I know it's too broad, but I
      think it's the goal of this course, isn't it?</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Learning about XML and Swing widgets.</I></LI>


    </UL>

      <LI>If you could give one piece of advice to someone taking this
      course in the future, what would it be?</LI>

    <UL>

      <LI><I>1) Start on projects early.  2) Figure out how packages
      work in the first week.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Read ahead.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I would suggest, naturally, starting early; especially
      project 4.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Look over the notes early.  Stay on top of the projects.
      Don't get discouraged and ask for help if you need it.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Spend a few days a week on this class because there is
      alot of information to learn.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Can learn different features of Java language.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Spend a little time (re)familiarizing yourself with the
      Java basics so you can focus on the material and not the
      language itself.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Review OOP.  Have free time to program.  Make sure Dave
      is your instructor.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Take time to draw a visiual picture of the projects
      before starting to write code.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Approach Java with a new mindset instead of approaching
      it with a different programming language mindset.  Be very
      familiar with the APIs.  Be prepared to write small test
      programs so that you can figure out how different methods work
      in a class.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Learn how to use ANT early.  It will save you time during
      development.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Pay attention and get your projects done.  This stuff
      will be useful.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Be prepared.  The projects are not so heavy as long as
      you know what Java classes are defined there and ready to be
      used.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Start the projects as early as possible, and don't take
      another programming class at the same time.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Know a little Java beforehand, since there will be more
      program project and have fun.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Nothing -- take this course if you really wants to learn
      Java.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>This class is tough.  A lot of works, so anyone taking
      this class needs a lot of time.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Should not take two programming classes together,
      especially operating system.  Take one class and study and get
      full knowlegde.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Keep up with the assignments and GO TO LECTURE</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Make sure you understand classpaths before signing up (or
      at least comfortable with them).  Don't fall behind.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>If you don't know Java, try to do some simple programs on
      your own before you take the class.  Anything helps.  And make
      sure you really know the concepts of programming in some other
      language such as C++.  That's what helped me a lot!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Understand a concept of OOP, and you're good to
      go.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Get a head start fr every single project.  Don't wait
      till the last minute.  The projects are doable, but they take a
      lot of time.</I></LI>

    </UL>     

      <LI>What made you stay in this course?</LI>

    <UL>

      <LI><I>It was fun to play with Java.  I liked the fact that
      instructor was understanding.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The material is interesting.  I liked how Java extends
      C++ from creating the class and its function to using a
      predefined class with its predefined functions.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The content, the jokes, the projects in which I learned
      very useful and practical things.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The teacher.  Overall the lectures were extremely
      informative and this language is now on of the most widely
      used.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The course was extremely well-organized and the teacher
      was very understanding of our schedules.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Because the course is not just focu on one big topic, so
      it gets my interests.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I liked Dave's teaching style and the course was
      informative.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Good thing to put on your resume.  Powerful language to
      know.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Well, programming I enjoy, and I think this is the area
      that strikes my interest.  Compiler and AI I don't care
      for.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The instructor was great.  He was passionate about the
      subject and was willing to help.  Most importantly he's very
      understanding.  The material was interesting.  Even though I had
      a hard time trying to figure out Java, it was a good challenge
      fo rme to keep working on it.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It was well structured, fun, and I learned a lot.  Didn't
      slow down to the slowest students.  Also, Dave's jokes.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It is one of the most useful courses I've taken.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I've been enjoying the lectures and the projects.  The
      stuff we've been teaching are great.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Graphic design, or GUI, was the thing I wanted to
      learn.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Learn[ing] Java is fun, compare to other programming
      language, you can expect to do anything with it and less
      restriction.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The language Java -- in first two week I don't like,
      because I don't know Java, but as weeks passed, I feel this
      language is really interesting.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I like this class.  GUI program, network, funny teacher!
      He could be serious, too.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The letcures, the kindness of Dave, and even material and
      projects.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The material was relevant and the prof. was
      great.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java is like C++ without the fangs, so it is a lot of
      fun.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The need to graduate :) and Dave's mercy!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Projects are fun and enjoyable.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The passion for Java...j/k.  I don't know.  I guess it's
      a worthwhile class.  I learn a lot of new concepts this
      term.</I></LI>
