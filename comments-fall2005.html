    <h1>Previously on CS399J...</h1>

    <p>This term marked the five year anniversary of CS399J.  We
    covered a ton of material and the students did really well.  Let's
    hear what they have to say.</p>

    <ol>

      <LI>What do you wish you had known before taking this
      course?</LI>

    <UL><!-- One --->

    <LI>Nothing, I think I was at the right skill level to get the most out
of it.</LI>

    <LI>I can't think of anything</LI>

    <LI>Some/any Java class or any intro CS class that used Java.  I
<u>did</u> that.</LI>

    <LI>I think anything about multithreading (i.e. if I took an operating
systems class) would have made the topic less frightening.</LI>

    <LI>To read *all* the links regarding weekly assignment.</LI>

    <LI>Some fundamental idea about OOP</LI>

    <LI>/* No comment */  I really can't think of anything</LI>

    <LI>I could have saved some initial headache by understanding Java's
naming convention relative to package names, etc.</LI>

    <LI>The Swing API</LI>

    <LI>I had little experience programming with sockets and threads.  The
notions of wait/notify are hard to grasp.</LI>

    <LI>To complete the first assignments in 1 week, not two.  The later
assignments took a lot longer to complete than the earlier ones, too.</LI>

    <LI>More Java.  (This is the first term I've coded in Java).</LI>

    <LI>Nothing, really.</LI>

    <LI>How fast paced the class is.</LI>

    <LI>Nothing, everything required was taught</LI>

    <LI>More knowledge about java programming would have been nice.</LI>


</UL>

      <LI>What is the most important thing you have learned in
      CS399J?</LI>

    <UL> <!-- Two -->

    <LI>Swing, even though mine were horrible</LI>

    <LI>The information about what's available in the standard libraries.</LI>

    <LI>EVERYTHING</LI>

    <LI>I think CS399J provided an excellent overview of hot to use Java to
tackle some very relevant programming concerns (i.e. XML, GUI
programming, sockets, and networking programing, multithreading).</LI>

    <LI>For me: Swing</LI>

    <LI>GUI and socket programming</LI>

    <LI>The most important thing is probably how to digest features about an
unfamiliar language.  Also, I have learned the "program to the
interface" mantra more concretely.</LI>

    <LI>I am amazed at how comprehansive trhe support for so many real time
needs are included in Java.</LI>

    <LI>Learned some things about networking which had not been covered in
any other course I have taken even though I have almost graduated</LI>

    <LI>Java is a greadt language with many built in features that make it
quite powerful, but you have to know what you're doing.  It's a bit
overwhelming because there are so many things you can do.  I really
enjoyed learning this language because it feels really intuitive.</LI>

    <LI>Program to the interface!  Also, how to use JUNit and Ant.</LI>

    <LI>Java APIs are the greatest tool in the world.</LI>

    <LI>GUI programming, networking, learned more about OOP in general</LI>

    <LI>The most important thing I learned was structure of the clas
hierarchy, and how that knowledge with the Javadocs can be used to
create almost any type of program.</LI>

    <LI>The advantages of OOP</LI>

    <LI>Two things tie for most important, the networking (server,
    cleint programming) and GUI programming. I've been curious about
    both for a long time. I think that no matter what, those three
    projects should always be a part of the course.</LI>


</UL>

      <LI>If you could give one piece of advice to someone taking this
      course in the future, what would it be?</LI>

    <UL><!-- Three -->

    <LI>Do your POA's</LI>

    <LI>Try to get ahead on the projects since they're all available at the
beginning of the term.</LI>

    <LI>Take any CS/programming class that uses Java.</LI>

    <LI>Make sure to read Whitlock's Javadoc and look at his sample code,
especially when attempthing things completely new to you; all
available on his website.</LI>

    <LI>Read *all* the links on the website</LI>

    <LI>Study and research more from outside of the class (maybe Java
tutorial from Sun)</LI>

    <LI>Ask questions and write unit tests for every program.</LI>

    <LI>Start early on the assignments and spend some time everyday on
them.</LI>

    <LI>Start the first project early, and continue to do so throughout the
course.</LI>

    <LI>Be sure to give this class enough time.  Towards the end of the term
I was spending over 15 hours per project.  Don't fall behind.</LI>

    <LI>Maybe to make sure they have more Java than the little you get in
CS202.</LI>

    <LI>Take his advice on what classes you shouldn't take while taking this
class.</LI>

    <LI>Start your programming assignments early</LI>

    <LI>Start early</LI>

    <LI>Be prepared to code a lot</LI>

    <LI>The advice I would give is to start reading about xml parsing
    right away.</LI>


</UL>

    <LI>What made you stay in this course?</LI>

    <UL><!-- Four -->

    <LI>Desire to learn the in's and out's of Java.  I also didn't want tot
take the handwriting course, so I had to maintain full time.</LI>

    <LI>I enjoyed the lectures, and the workload was very managible.</LI>

    <LI>Everything: I [heart] CS</LI>

    <LI>I didn't think there was a whole lot of interest the first couple of
weeks, but once the class got going we started ot delve into many
things I had not done before in any language and I appreciated that.
Also as part of MECOP, I saw many companies utilize XML and Java and
so I saw much relevance in what we were learning.</LI>

    <LI>To learn more and satisfy degree requirements</LI>

    <LI>A lot (in most things).</LI>

    <LI>I like Java, and the material is considerably more interesting than
that of "normal" CS classes.</LI>

    <LI>I learned so much every week.  This was very reinforcing.  It was
actually fun.</LI>

    <LI>I was forced to learn a lot about Java.  I probably would not have
don this of my own volition.</LI>

    <LI>Dave, you're a good instructor and your enthusiasm for the material
helps sustain my interest.  I also really like the language and
thought the projects were well thought out and not too big.</LI>

    <LI>Well, it's really fun, Java's super cool, and I feel like I'm
learning a lot.</LI>

    <LI>Cuz I'm stubborn (and I had a lot of time to work on homework)</LI>

    <LI>I like what I've learned and I need to satisfy an ECE CS elective
requirement.</LI>

    <LI>The subject is very interesting, and we covered such a large range
of information I wanted to learn as much as I could</LI>

    <LI>The usefulness of the projects and the amount of Java that was
covered.</LI>

    <LI>The lectures are entertaining, and java is a great language to
    learn.</LI>
