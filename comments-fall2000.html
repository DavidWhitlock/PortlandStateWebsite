    <h1>Previously on CS410J...</h1>

<P>When I taught CS410J in the fall I asked my students the following
questions on the last day of class (after plying them with pizza -- a
little trick I learned from Doug Comer).</P>

<OL>

<LI>What do you wish you had known before taking this course?</LI>

<UL>

<LI><I>Object-oriented concepts.  I still have to think about how
objects interact, etc.</I></LI>

<LI><I>More about Solaris, UNIX...</I></LI>

<LI><I>How to write Java applications</I></LI>

<LI><I>I think [a] little bit more knowledge about OOPs might have
helped understanding quickly.</I></LI>

<LI><I>More UNIX experience, or a crash course in UNIX (classpaths,
jar files, etc.)</I></LI>

<LI><I>That the 1st program was going to be so <U>damned</U> hard.
That you would go very fast.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Directory structure for compiling/packaging.</I></LI>

<LI><I>More about networking, GUI and threads</I></LI>

<LI><I>A little OOP, I had a hard time starting but its been more or
less fine ever since.</I></LI>

<LI><I>That I shouldn't buy the book.</I></LI>

<LI><I>How about oriented language works.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Some basic Java first.</I></LI>

<LI><I>How the Java compiler handles files, directories, class paths,
packages, and such because that was the hardest thing to
learn.</I></LI>

<LI><I>A little more about the UNIX OS and a better understanding of
xterm!</I></LI>

<LI><I>I would have like to have been more familiar with OOP and how
Java implements it (implements and extends) mainly C# (just
joking)</I> [Don't get me started on C#!]</LI>

<LI><I>More object oriented programming knowledge</I></LI>

<LI><I>Stronger Object oriented skills</I></LI>

</UL>

<LI>What is the most import thing you have learned in CS410J?</LI>

<UL>

<LI><I>How easily Java code can be to write.  Once one is acclimated,
with stong type checking and explicit compiler errors it is really
easy to prototype and test applications (no more pointer
goose-chases).</I></LI>

<LI><I>How to compile and run Java programs.  How to look up stuff in
the Java docs.  A better appreciation of object-orientation.</I></LI>

<LI><I>That OOP in Java kicks hiney [sic] against socket programming
with pointers!  Garbage collection is cool.</I></LI>

<LI><I>I gain confidence in programming</I></LI>

<LI><I>Object programming make program simpler</I></LI>

<LI><I>I have learned how object oriented programming works and
inheritance...</I></LI>

<LI><I>That Java has some excellent features/advantages and that it
certainly has a good future.</I></LI>

<LI><I>I thought the team work projects were the most educational.
Too often we all operate in out little boxes and don't get out.
Speaking with others about topics that are cool - like Java were very
good.  It opened my eyes and ears.  The assignment were stiff and
challenging but they taught me Java the most.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Concpets of OOP and experience in OOP and building
GUIs.</I></LI>

<LI><I>There really wasn't <U>one</U> things -- I'm just glad I got
through review of the Java basics...</I></LI>

<LI><I>The manner in which Java is implemented: standard class
library, compatability problems, no good development tools for UNIX,
global file structure for classes</I></LI>

<LI><I>OOP, a XML API</I></LI>

<LI><I>Using Abstract Classes to set up the frame work.  Setting up my
own Exception class for reporting errors.. ParserException to
standardize Exception reporting.  Better understanding of GUI
interaction.</I></LI>

<LI><I>As I haven't done any programming in Java. Everything is new
and important to me.  I especially like GUI and socket programming.
(Project 5 was fun to work on.)</I></LI>

<LI><I>Networking and threads</I></LI>

<LI><I>The whole reason I took this class was so I could put a front
end on my programs.  So, the GUI stuff.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Swing was cool!  Wish I had more time to do the last
project.</I></LI>

<LI><I>The basics, syntax rules (like not pass by ref), in the
language.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Basic Java functionality.  Java programming style.</I></LI>

</UL>

<LI>If you could give one piece of advice to someone taking this
course in the future, what would it be?</LI>

<UL>

<LI><I>Learn how to compile and set up simple little Java programs
before you start any projects</I></LI>

<LI><I>Work hard at the beginning!</I></LI>

<LI><I>Get the project done right!  Start early.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Don't be fooled by Dave's willingness to give you extra time --
finish your projects on time!</I></LI>

<LI><I>Have persistence, patience, and be self-motivated</I></LI>

<LI><I>Get all the details about the requirement of the project.
Don't assume anything.  Do exactly whatever is specified.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Stay on top of it and start the work early.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Take it from Dave.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Be ready for a lot of work, and have intimate C++
knowledge.</I> ["I'm only going to say this once.  I did <B>not</B>
have programmatic relations with that language, C++."]</LI>

<LI><I>Know the basics about Java and the Colelctions classes.  Know
something about networking and threads.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Be sure you meet the following requirements: Understand OOD,
Unix, Data structures.  This is a SENIOR level class.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Don't wast time getting started and familiarize yourself with
the tools available, i.e. "Java docs"</I></LI>

<LI><I>Buy a Java Refrence book and Programming Book in the areas
you're intrested in.  Java Docs are not always enough.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Make sure you have plenty of time!!!  I spend about 20 hours of
coding for 1 day of class!</I></LI>

<LI><I>Make sure you have lots of time for the projects.  Interact
with your peers.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Read the book closely to understand the language.  Tell Dave to
slow down.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Although you learn a lot, there is a lt of work and time you
will need to put into this course.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Know some Java</I></LI>

</UL>

<LI>What made you stay in this course?</LI>

<UL>

<LI><I>Learning new things and challenge to new tasks.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Java is interesting and the exercise in class are
motivating.</I></LI>

<LI><I>You like what you're doing -- you like to teach -- you use your
hands to explain things.  The projects were way hard -- especially at
first -- not boring.</I></LI>

<LI><I>I like challenges.</I></LI>

<LI><I>How much I was learning.</I></LI>

<LI><I>I found programming Java fun (believe it or not)</I> [I believe
you.]</LI>

<LI><I>I wanted to learn more about java --> RMI, networking, threads
(Didn't get to RMI, but nice try)</I></LI>

<LI><I>I like Programming in Java.  (Yeah, I'm a DORK!)  I figure, if
I stick to it and show that I am trying hard to make my programs work,
I'll get at least a "C" so that I don't have to retake this
class.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Herr Prof. Whitlock!  Really, you've developed an excellent
rapport with the class, and always kept lectures worth
attending.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Needed upper division credit in CS.</I></LI>

<LI><I>True Grit.  Seriously, I enjoyed learning the language and I
got 12 pts on the first program.</I> [That's 12 out of 12.]</LI>

<LI><I>I've never quit anything in my life.  The first project was
challengin but I am paying PSU to learn, not coast.</I></LI>

<LI><I>In spite you... nah ..just kidding.  I like Java and have
pretty good instincts with it.  I lacked the formal instruction and
smack down to do it correctly.  and I'm Irish and we don't give up or
leave the bar without a fight. :)</I></LI>

<LI><I>Lecture was more interesting than my other classes, wanted to
learn Java.</I></LI>

<LI><I>All the Fun.</I></LI>

<LI><I>I enjoyed it.  I wanted to learn the material.  I paid for the
course.  It was easy.  Well till the end :|</I></LI>

<LI><I>I enjoyed the challenge and like learning Java, and I need the
credits to graduate.</I></LI>

<LI><I>I enjoyed the material.  I really learned a lot out of the
course and Dave is an excellent instructor.</I></LI>

<LI><I>Determination to learn Java.  Started developing interest after
something (earlier project) started waning.</I></LI>

</UL>

</OL>

<P>One thing that I like about my students is that they're always more
than happy to give me feedback about my teaching.  Sometimes they use
more than one finger.  Based on my experiences with this class I've
decided to spend a little more time at the beginning on the language
aspects of Java, object oriented programming, and compilation.</P>

<P>Thanks, guys.</P>
