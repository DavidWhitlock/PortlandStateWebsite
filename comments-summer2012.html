    <h1>Previously on CS410J...</h1>

    <p>Added some new stuff this term.  What did the students think?</p>

    <ol>

      <li>What do you wish you had known before taking this
      course?</li>

      <ul><!-- One -->

        <li>Would  have like to know more about the Goggle Web ToolKit.</li>
        <li>I did not register early enough to know the Java review pod casts. If I've known them, I would have listened to them prior to starting the class.    I have taken some C++ class long time ago, but I have not used it since them. In the lecture, there were some discussion on the comparison between C based language and Java. Having more experience in C based language would have helped me to understand the reference. However, I did not think that it was crucial. </li>
        <li>I wish I had a little more background in some of the more advanced topics like Dependency Injection. They were a little difficult to follow during the lecture.</li>
        <li>I felt like I kne wpretty much everything I needed to know.</li>
        <li>I hope I could have known much more about Java. Have a strong java background is very important for this course.</li>
        <li>I wish i had know more about mvn, Junit testing and more about client server technology.</li>
        <li>Some new java framwork and technology.</li>
        <Li>Object Oriented Programming.</Li>
        <li>a little more about file i/o.   a little more about html and css.</li>
        <li>No comment.</li>
        <li>A basic groundwork in Web services. I knew a fair amount about Java the language but nothing about how it is used on the Web and that was a major part of the course. The web services part was glossed over in trying to learn Java to deal with it.</li>
        <li>I wish I had done a few more Java programs in my other CS courses. I wish that I would have had a bit more web experience (in any language).</li>
        <li>A little more about remote service serialization and how that works under the hood.</li>
        <li>How to follow test-driven development</li>
        <li>Some maven packaging. wasn't really covered in class</li>
        <li>More about Google Web Toolkit.</li>
        <li>Better understanding of client/server and web programming.</li>
        <li>I wish that I had known more about command line parsing. I think the biggest pain point for me was the command line parsing and String manipulation.</li>
        <li>A bit more about Maven.</li>
        <li>More about basic structure of Java - especially terminology.  Also, more about how to use the tools such as Idea.  Each assignment became easier as I was spending more time writing code and less and less setting up the environment.</li>
        <li>The unit testing, it help me in doing the coding for the projects.</li>
        <li>I really like the review of the Java language and the core Java API. I learned them a couple years ago, but this class helped me to understand them better.</li>
        <li>I learned about a lot of the common Java API's, including the way servlets work. I think this was the most important.</li>
        <li>API's are my friend</li>

      </ul>

      <li>What is the most important thing you have learned in
        CS399J?</li>

      <ul> <!-- Two -->

        <li>Some advanced thing about Java that i have never heard of before since I am very new to Java.</li>
        <li>This was the first time that i have dealt with client server problems in java</li>
        <li>GWT, unit testing skills, and mvp design pattern. </li>
        <li>I learnt to look at Java as an object oriented language and not like C programming language.</li>
        <li>I thought the most important things were: (1) the tour of the language features via the koans.    (2) the tour of the state-of-the-art standard practices of dependency-injection, reflection, class loaders, GWT and servlets.    (3) some nice maven tricks and stuff.</li>
        <li>How to work in a test driven development way, and also how to work with client server web applications.</li>
        <li>It's called CS410J this year.    Can't think of a "most important" thing for Java other than (maybe) the gwt tools for it. Probably the most important doesn't have to do with Java and is how the Web works with Java. </li>
        <li>That Java is ultimately a coder's best friend. Java seems like a very smart language (well at least the IDEs support a lot of functionality). The modularity and enforcement of OOP makes developing and designing the layout of a program amazingly awesome!</li>
        <li>Um. I am taking cs410, not cs399. But for cs410J, the most important thing I think is Test Driven Development. I don't work in Java now, but I am looking forward to using it once I do.</li>
        <li>How easy it is to do web dev with java</li>
        <li>Google web tool kit</li>
        <li>Servlets and other web stuff.</li>
        <li>Program to the interface!</li>
        <li>I think the most important thing I have learned is all of the core fundamentals of Java. I came into this class with some Java experience but I sort of skipped the fundamentals and this class filled in that foundation for me.</li>
        <li>Testing with JUnit. I'd never used it before, but it's pretty critical for Java programming.</li>
        <li>I learned a *lot* in this course - all about how to use Java, external libraries, web interface programming, how to use Idea's debugger (and various other Idea features like automatically importing external libraries).  Can't think of one single thing that stands out above the others.  </li>

      </ul>

      <li>If you could give one piece of advice to someone taking this
        course in the future, what would it be?</li>

      <ul><!-- Three -->

        <li>Stay on top of everything.</li>
        <li>Review the materials before the class. It will help to put your mind in the right framework. Listen to the lecture in class. However, do not worry if you do not understand some points in the class. Listen to the pod casts and consolidate your understanding. If something is still not clear, ask the instructor; he very willing to assist you.</li>
        <li>To do the unit tests for the projects, since they build on one another. The tests required a bit of refactoring as the requirements changed from project to project, but they gave a lot of security in knowing that the project wasn't broken by my changes.</li>
        <li>start projects early!</li>
        <li>Lots of work, seriously you need to start them earlier.</li>
        <li>Expect to get frustrated with GWT</li>
        <li>Have a roughly knowledge about how to configure maven, jetty and GWT on InteliJ or Eclipse.</li>
        <li>Don't be slacker.</li>
        <li>It is VERY time-consuming.  make sure you at least block off like a minimum of 8 or so hours a week to work on classwork.   Also, make sure you start the koans early on.   But don't worry, it's really worth it!  it's a great tour de force of the power of java.</li>
        <li>Start working on the programming assignments ASAP!  Don't wait.</li>
        <li>See Question #2.</li>
        <li>Get started on the projects early so you can pay attention to detail! And spend time developing to tests... it makes things sooo much easier!</li>
        <li>Plan to take some PTO to complete the work assigned.</li>
        <li>As for any other class - don't procrastinate. And have fun.</li>
        <li>Just tough out the first couple of weeks. It will get progressively better.</li>
        <li>Start early and ask questions.</li>
        <li>Clear your schedule! It's hard to get everything done in such a short timeframe.</li>
        <li>I would tell them to really think through the design of their projects before digging into it. I think that alot of students make that mistake and end up paying for it later on.</li>
        <li>Don't flake out on JUnit testing. You can complete the course without doing much work with JUnit, but do it anyway! It's useful!</li>
        <li>Make sure you have cleared enough time in your schedule to be sure of being able to spend 10-20 or more hours each weak working on assignments.</li>

      </ul>

      <li>What made you stay in this course?</li>

      <ul><!-- Four -->

        <li>The desire to learn more about java language.</li>
        <li>I knew that it was going to be challenging because I did not have that much programing experience. However, I did not want to give up in the middle of it. I also knew that the learning this course material would help me at work. </li>
        <li>The information seemed useful, and I use Java at work, so it's nice to have a good foundation for it.</li>
        <li>Dave looks like a pretty threatening guy that you don't want to mess with.  I didn't want to cross him.</li>
        <li>I have to pass this course in order to graduate.</li>
        <li>I really like the projects, They keep me challenged.  The fact that they built on one another helped me see the complexity from one process to the next</li>
        <li>This is not a class that just following the text book, such as thinking in JAVA. It has a few technolgy besides the java language, such as mvp design pattern, gwt framwork, and so forth.</li>
        <li>The projects were very helpful to get a better understanding of Java concepts.</li>
        <li>oh, well, there was never any thought of dropping it.  Everything in the course has been really good for me, and I've really enjoyed it.  it's a bit too much work though.</li>
        <li>I really liked the material.</li>
        <li>It approached, but did not pass, the bar for enough crap to make me leave. If I'd known or realized how much of the last half of the course was not going to be about Java but about Web material (which was just glossed over) I probably would have. But by then it was too late. </li>
        <li>It's relative content. I LOVE how applicable the content of this course was/is. It is some of the most exciting stuff to learn, and I feel like I'm at a point in my CS career that I am learning on the fly, and that's awesome!</li>
        <li>I was not made to stay.</li>
        <li>Knowing that Java is one of the most wanted skills in the industry</li>
        <li>The fact that the instructor was available for us to ask questions on google+.</li>
        <li>Lively projects.</li>
        <li>I love the material, and felt like I learned a lot. It was well worth the effort.</li>
        <li>The material/lectures were very interesting and the projects were challenging. I think the structure of the class was very good.</li>
        <li>I learned a lot of the deep dark corners of Java that I don't regularly encounter. And the projects were good practice of core Java skills.</li>
        <li>Wanted to learn Java programming.  Much of the material has already helped me in my job. Even though I'm not a programmer, I do spend a lot of time fixing issues that pop up in automated builds and merging of codebases, so an understanding how Java, and how all its myriad pieces work together, has been very useful.</li>

      </ul>
