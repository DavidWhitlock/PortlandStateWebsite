    <h1>Previously on CS399J...</h1>

    <P>Another huge class.  And since this was "advanced" Java we
    learned about GUI programming.  Let's see what the students
    thought about it...</P>

    <OL>

      <LI>What do you wish you had known before taking this
      course?</LI>

    <UL><!-- One --->

      <LI><I>I wish I had known more about basic java which could have
      helped me digest the material and the topics covered quicker and
      easier. Because I like to be creative and go beyond the
      limitations of the class. So hopefully this coming break, I will
      definitely be playing with java tools because it is really a fun
      language to learn.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I had more experience with programing before
      taking this class. Especially I wished I knew about basic Java
      before this.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish that I had better experience in C++ since I just
      finished my 162 and this class was the hardest class I did ever
      took.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I had some knowledge about java, the basic
      stuff.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Before taking this course, I wish I had been familiar
      with the Java API. OOP is a really nice concept, but being used
      to C++, I had a hard time with Java because all we do is reused
      code. I am used to reused code but all those convention that
      holds Java and structures it I wish I had known them ahead of
      time.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to use Eclipse with CVS</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Better understanding of UNIX</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wanted to know about networking and GUI programming in
      Java, and improce Java language skill.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to download all Dave's classes so I can compile on my
      own box instead of working remotely or at the FAB.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Nothing more than what I know</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I didn't know that there were 2 sections of the class.  I
      signed up for the "self support" sections and had to do battle
      with registration department to get my $500 back.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Nothing.  Dave did a great job of providing all the
      information we needed to be successful.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Nothing, whenever I wish to know about something, I go
      read about it.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Nothing</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Nothing.  I feel like this course started with the basics
      for Java and progressed at a reasonable pace.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I don't wish to know anything before -- but I've done a
      lot and know a lot by now.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>That I could have taken it before CS300.  So I would have
      been able to do that in Java instead of C++.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Possibly a little more expose to object oriented
      programming in general.  I really wish a textbook would have
      been required.  I know, I can do it on my own, but I guess I
      just do well with more structures.  The lectures/slides are
      good, though.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Learn all the Java standard API, and some overview of the
      JFC.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>That this was the only elective I needed (thought I
      needed two).  Other than that, nothing.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>To know more about Java programming.  Create
      GUI.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The amount of work involved, projects, assignments, final
      okay, but why two extra group assignments?</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I would have liked to know Ant a little better.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I had already learned about inheritance and classes i
      CS202 (C++ programming).  I think it would have been more
      difficult without that information as background.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I have knon more applets and XML.  I want to make
      Java game.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java.  :) Actually, I learned a lot about the different
      Java resources online throughout the course.  Would have been
      nice if I had those at my disposal when the class
      started.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to program well.  The course is perfect for someone
      with experience in another language.  Trying to learn Java
      syntax and programming methods is a lot to handle.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More experisnce with either the basics of Java or more
      experisnce with object oriented programming.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Not much.  Maybe X Windows connectivity so I could test
      my GUI on UNIX.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How Java related to web program</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I wish I'd known more about executing Java on the command
      line.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to create a GUI</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The characteristics/special language features of Java
      language.  The reasons Java can run across platform.  The
      reasons Java is getting popular nowadays.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More about setting up and using cygwin.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I've learned C++ which was only programming language in
      my CS courses.  So I always wanted to learn some graphic
      features that I can play with 'em.  Also, how to make efficient
      program.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>ActionListener.  Network.</I></LI>


    </UL>

      <LI>What is the most important thing you have learned in
      CS399J?</LI>

    <UL> <!-- Two -->


      <LI><I>The most important think I have learned is CS399J is the
      GUI stuff. In all of my other computer science classes, I always
      wondered how I could convert my codes and programs to something
      that could be understood by others who have no knowledge about
      programming and coding. I have done some really interesting
      projects in my other classes and know I will try to implement
      them and create a graphic interface for them.  </I></LI>

      <LI><I>I learned about how to program in Java</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java programming and how to catch to the class in better
      way.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to code using java language which is a little bit
      different than other languages. </I></LI>

      <LI><I>The most important thing I have learned in CS399J is
      testing. I knew the importance of OOP and am pretty familiar
      with it. But testing never had such a huge impact on my coding
      other than in this class. Also I learned the impotance of
      writing clean and correct code so that people can reuse
      them. Mine wasn¡¦t corrent and it penalized me for the rest of
      the course since we had to reuse the code. It can be pretty
      frustrating.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>MVC and how to use Ant</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Object oriented programming with Java</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The most importand thing I've learned was object oriented
      properties of Java and the ability to make code modular and wasy
      to debug and understand</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Learning to make GUISs and using javadocs; using Java's
      prebuilt classes, APIs</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java and Javadocs</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Programming with extensibility in mind, especially how
      Java faclitates that.  (Program to the interface)</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The most importand reference in a language like Java is
      the API reference -- knowing the tools is almost more importand
      than the language syntax.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java!  More specifically the differences between Java and
      .NET.  Javadocs are awesome and C# has no real implementation of
      MVC.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Probably it being a good example of developement
      practices, as well as a good semi-in-depth understanding of the
      various Java technologies.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>GUI programming.  Most of the non-GUI stuff I already
      know.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Object oriented programming style</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I have a much etter grasp of designing reusable, portable
      code, ineritance (which I only vaguely understood before) and
      polymorphism.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>GUI programming, packets</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Checking error in your projects as much as you
      could</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Thought the GUI stuff was really good</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I learned that Java is powerful and very "learnable" if
      you put time into it.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>To know what is available in Java API, and how to use
      them.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Swing</I></LI>

      <LI><I>GUI, Swing.  I love them.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>GUI programming with Java, AWT/Swing</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Use of the javadocs came in handy.  I can pretty much
      figure out anything from the javadocs now.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to research and use Sun's Javadocs.  Very
      helpful.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I elarn how to program in Java and what different between
      Java and C++.  I also learn Swing and GUI.  I like those
      stuff.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Object oriented program design.  I'm a big fan of it
      now.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>How to find a functionality in an existing class using
      the Javadocs and plugging it into a program.  Design patterns
      runs second.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java provides a rich set of tools for modeling computing
      solutions.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>MVC</I></LI>

      <LI><I>(Abstract class) object oriented concepts.  GUI.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Swing!  I now want to pursue a career in GUI
      design.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Everything!  This class has vastly improved my knowledge
      of Java, from the rudamentary to the advanced topics.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Understand the Java language and how to program with
      it.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>New concepts of OOP (garbage collection), core API and
      useful tool package (JUnit).</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The important of clearly defined requirements.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java!  GUI.  I think writing a basic GUI is a pretty
      fundamental skill for a Computer Scientist to have.  Be able to
      present and visualize data is very important.  Compared to C++,
      Java Rocks!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>After project 1a assignment I'ce got low grade of my
      project so everytime I had to fix my program.  Then I realized
      what exactly my probem was.  I think that I learned how to
      figure the concept out.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Package.  Hierarchy.</I></LI>


    </UL>

      <LI>If you could give one piece of advice to someone taking this
      course in the future, what would it be?</LI>

    <UL><!-- Three -->

      <LI><I>I would encourage him/her to write a POA before starting
      any program because it really helps and if possible have the
      instructor or somebody else look at the POA and evaluate its
      efficiency give suggestions to improve it because I really found
      it helpful to write a POA that organizes your work and makes you
      think than code rather than using the method of "trial and
      error".</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Read the Head first Java book before taking this class If
      you have no experience with the Java programing. At the
      beginning of the class I realized I need some extra help with
      Java then I found this book at the library. while I was doing my
      homework and studies for the class, I did study this book as
      well. </I></LI>

      <LI><I>It is not taking advance java class before taking the
      basic java also it is better to have good experience in C++.
      </I></LI>

      <LI><I>He should have at least some idea of what java is
      about.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>If I could give one piece of advice it will be to really
      understand your goal and write a Plan of attack and stick to
      it. Of course understand how to search the API is important too.
      Also you are competing with people from the Industry and Senior
      or people who have been exposed to Java so it can be pretty
      frustrating as they know more than you do.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Start thinking about project design first and as early as
      possible</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Start early on the projects</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Read the slides and plan before coding.  Start thinking
      and researching early to get the best project solution</I></LI>

      <LI><I>If you really study the lecture notes Dave provides,
      most/all your questions will be answered to solve (finish)
      assignments (so you don't need to bother Dave)</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Don't hestitate</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Pay special attention to the aptterns/practices that you
      see/learn.  Study Dave's code for labs/quizzes/and good
      practice.  He does things in his examples you probably would not
      think of on your own.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Read Dave's sample code on the web site.  Make a
      link/bookmark to the API docs -- you will use them a
      lot.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Plan ahead, there is a lot of programming in thie calss.
      Make sure it will fit into your schedule.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Get at least a basic undertanding of Java before you go
      into the class.  It will allow you to learn about the finer
      (more valuable) points of Java instead of fighting to learn the
      basics.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Show up to class</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Study hard</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Pay close attention to that wacky Dave -- you'll miss is
      quirky humor if you don't</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Study a little Java before taking this course</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Be prepared -- there will be a lot of time required to do
      the projects</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Drink plenty of coffee before class so you can keep up
      with Dave talking.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Keep up with the projects.  Make sure you will have time
      for the class before registering.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>More lecture on AWT and Swing, and shorten the lecture on
      the language.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Pay attention to the basics, for they shall serve thee
      well.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The best elective course -- enjoy the project -- they are
      fun.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Be prepared for more difficult sasignments later on in
      the course.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Use the javadocs and make sure to comment your code.
      Start project early. Take the time to learn XML.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Start projects early.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Do the program early.  The program is easy.  But it take
      time.  The last program is always the hardest.  Read some Java
      book to undertand more about the subject.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Don't leave projects until the last minue.  don't forget
      to laugh at Dave's jokes.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Start the assignments early.  Right after lecture would
      be good.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Ask questions.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Learn and use Java before taking this class (it is
      advanced) or you must be comfortable with object-oriented
      programming concepts in order to survive this class.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Good class, very useful program, and fun</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Stay on top of the assignments -- do them ahead of time
      and you will thank yourself!  This gives you time to tinker,
      which you'll want to do -- especially with Swing.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Ask questions about the assignments lest you lose
      points.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Don't take with compiler or OS class because it's time
      consuming.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>If the one has already know OOP characteristics, just go
      ahead and enjoy it!</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Ask questions to clearly define what is required for the
      projects.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Java Rocks -- forget C++.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I can say that "Check Dave's website and understand his
      Java work!"  Ah...use mailing list.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Start early.  Good design document.</I></LI>


    </UL>     

      <LI>What made you stay in this course?</LI>

    <UL><!-- Four -->


      <LI><I>More than one reason: 1) The help and feedback we used to
      get from our instructor via emails.  2) The desire to learn GUI.
      3) Because we're required to take an uper division CS class and
      java was the most intersting one among others.  </I></LI>

      <LI><I>This course even thought wasn't easy for me but it was
      interesting and useful. I like the challenge, I thought I will
      stay to try and to learn more. </I></LI>

      <LI><I>My teacher is really understandable person, and I
      strongly want to learn java programming language.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The instructor made me stay in this course because he is
      very nice and very understandable (clearly explains the
      material).</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I stayed in this course because I understand the
      emergence of Java in software application. I really C/C++ but it
      is mostly used only in firmware. I would like to become a
      software programmer in the future.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I enjoyed the material and the class</I></LI>


      <LI><I>Java is run.  Enjoyed the lectures and the
      projects.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Interesting material, and friendly class
      environment.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Everything...honestly.  I learned a lot and it was FUN!
      ASsignments were challenging but not overbearing.  I like the
      one-night-a-week course.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Great instructor, helpful slides and examples, GUI,
      Java</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Quality lectures/quality lab assignments</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I really wanted experience with Java because of its
      prevalence in industry.  The level (conceptual) of the lectures
      was appropriate for my level of programming experience.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Good teacher, good topic, and I need the credits.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Excellent instruction and subject matter.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I want to graduate someday</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Why would I leave?</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I like what I was learning</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I needed it.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The projects are interesting, and the lectures are simple
      and clear.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Best programming class I ever had.  Love Java.  Thought
      the assignments were well thought-out, challenging and very
      useful.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I really wanted to just tough it out.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I want to know the advantage of the Java
      technology.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I liked it</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The project is very fun to work, although it's time
      consuming.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Counts as an elective</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I enjoyed the assignments and the lectures.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Great class.  Lots of new material.  Fun
      projects.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>The reason is Java is fun and does make a lot of cool
      website.  I want to make those website for my boss.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I was interested in the subject matter.  I needed the
      credits.  I had a lot of quick, positive feedback on how I was
      doing.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I want to be able to write programs to analyze data.
      Learning more about Java I felt it was in many ways an easy to
      use language.  For example, garbage collection and memory
      issues.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I was learning a lot of interesting material.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Lots of things.  I never wanted to leave.  It was taught
      well by an engaging, attentative, and knowledgeable
      professional.  The subject matter added to my prior experience
      with Java, GUI design, and OOP.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I want to know Java as much as I can</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I liked everything about it.  Java is a great language
      and the assignments were useful.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>It was either this or join a violence gang.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I think you are a great professor.  The lecture and
      assignment perfect suitable for this course.  The material and
      examples very clear for me when I read through and able to find
      answer when I'm doing assignment.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I intended to see more advanced techniques of using Java
      to write program.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I'm a sucker!  No really, I enjoyed learning about Java.
      I liked the lectures, I liked the projects.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I paid $550 tuition -- do not want to lose it!  Was an
      interesting class and an interesting subject.  Learning Java is
      key to budding Computer Scientists.</I></LI>

      <LI><I>Instructor!  :)</I></LI>

      <LI><I>I could learn about Java from bottom to top.</I></LI>
